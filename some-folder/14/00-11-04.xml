         <p><persName id="12">Nicholson</persName> assisted at 8 a.m. I was glad of his help, being still very feeble. He also read Mattins, &amp; Celebrated at 11 a.m. I preached an old sermon.</p>
         <p>The assembly at my lecture was not quite so numerous as on the former occasion, but the chapel seemed well filled. It was no mean exertion to speak for a whole hour on end, but I was interested &amp; the people attentive, so we got thro' better than I expected. The Organist's sister, <persName id="58">Miss Ella Johnstone</persName>, sang a couple of solos in the "short sacred concert". She has a remarkably rich powerful voice, &amp; manages it well. The offertory for the Organ amounted to &#x00A3;3.0.9.</p>
         <p>I sent <persName id="19">Frank</persName> &amp; <persName id="61">Harman</persName> to Barking with a note to <persName id="62">Kirshbaum</persName>, asking for help. He sent me <persName id="63">Duke</persName>, who sang the service very fairly. I preached another old sermon.</p>
