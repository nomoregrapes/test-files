         <p>I celebrated at 8 a.m. There were 24 communicants. The congregation at 11 a.m. was greater, &amp; that at 7 p.m. was less than usual. Only 17 men attended my Bible Class. <persName id="26">Bob Bayliss</persName> lunched with me, &amp; I admitted him to be a <orgName id="2">Chancellor</orgName>. <persName id="27">Harry Walgrave</persName> came to tea &amp; stayed to Church service. I gave him a copy of <ref id="2">"Light &amp; Leaven"</ref>.</p>
         <p><persName id="28">Dick Rosser</persName> came to supper.</p>

         <p>On Tuesday the 30<hi rend="sup u">th</hi> October, I travelled to Colchester in company with <persName id="30">Shadwell</persName>.<note id="2" n="1"></note>  <hi rend="b u">We picked up </hi><persName id="31"><hi rend="b u">Lord W</hi><hi rend="b sup u">m</hi> <hi rend="b u"> Cecil</hi></persName><hi rend="b u"> on the way to the Corn Exchange, where we arrived just in time to hear the concluding sentences of the <persName id="10">Bishop</persName>'s opening speech.</hi>  We went out to lunch at <persName id="23">General Gatacre</persName>'s.  Thereafter returning to the Conference we found ourselves too late for the discussion about Missions, which had unaccountably collapsed.  <hi rend="b u">I made a rather foolish <event id="3">speech</event> about subdivision of parishes, &amp; was rent by the Bp. of Colchester with astonishing acerbity</hi>
            <hi rend="b">.</hi>  I stayed at <placeName id="2">Scarletts</placeName>, where also <persName id="33">Nairne</persName> &amp; <persName id="34">Burrell</persName> were entertained.  The next day <persName id="35">Andrew Johnston</persName> introduced the Temperance question in a characteristic speech, &amp; was followed by Arthur Shadwell in an admirable paper.  <hi rend="b u">I followed him with a <event id="4">speech</event> which was inordinately unwise.<note id="44" n="2"></note>  On my return to Ilford, I found that a letter from <persName id="36">Lord Salisbury</persName> had just been forwarded to Oxford. I received it in the course of the following day (Nov: 1</hi><hi rend="b sup u">st</hi><hi rend="b u">). It was an offer of the vacant Westminster Canonry.<note id="3" n="3"></note> I showed it to the <persName id="228">Warden</persName>, <persName id="38">Sub Warden</persName>, <persName id="39">Doyle</persName>, <persName id="40">Harrison</persName>, &amp; <persName id="41">Davis</persName> under pledge of secrecy. Then I wrote &amp; accepted the offer.</hi>  The excitement of this sudden change in my fortunes prostrated me, &amp; I spent All Souls Day most miserably in bed &amp; on my sofa under the Dual Control of <persName id="54">Edwards</persName> &amp; the Doctor.  I so far revived as to take part in the election of <persName id="42">Steel</persName> &amp; <persName id="43">M<hi rend="sup u">c</hi>Doughal</persName> to <orgName id="7">fellowship</orgName> on the 3<hi rend="sup u">rd</hi> Nov.</p>

         <p>Dear M<hi rend="sup u">r</hi> Henson,</p>
         <p>Her Majesty allows me to ask you whether you will accept the Canonry at Westminster Abbey, which is vacant by the transference of <persName id="44">Canon Robinson</persName> to the Stall which was occupied by <persName id="45">Canon Furse</persName>. I should be very glad if you saw your way to the acceptance of this appointment as it will give you a wider and more influential audience as a preacher.</p>
         <p>Believe me</p>
         <p>Yours very Truly</p>
         <p>Salisbury</p></div><p></p><div type="letter">

         <p>My Lord,</p>
         <p>I have the honour to acknowledge your Lordship's letter of October 30<hi rend="sup u">th</hi> conveying Her Majesty's gracious proposal that I should accept the vacant Canonry at Westminster Abbey. After careful consideration I conceive it to be my duty to do so, &amp; in announcing that decision to your Lordship I desire to add my sincere thanks for you Lordship's kindness.</p>
         <p>I have the honour etc.</p>
