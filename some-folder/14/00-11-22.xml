         <p>I wrote letters, &amp; prepared my <event id="89">speech</event> for the Bicentenary meeting in Stratford Town Hall. The meeting was well&#8211;attended; the Hall being quite full. <persName id="53">Canon Farmer</persName> of Pretoria was the other speaker: a most dreary orator. I spoke for nearly an hour, but the people did not seem to weary. Afterwards the <persName id="10">Bp</persName>. thanked me warmly for my "magnificent" speech. Thus I finished what I suppose is my last public appearance as a beneficed priest in this diocese.</p>
