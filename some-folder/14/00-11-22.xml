         <p>I wrote letters, &amp; prepared my <listEvent><event xml:id="89" display="no">speech</event></listEvent> for the Bicentenary meeting in Stratford Town Hall. The meeting was well&#8211;attended; the Hall being quite full. <persName xml:id="53">Canon Farmer</persName> of Pretoria was the other speaker: a most dreary orator. I spoke for nearly an hour, but the people did not seem to weary. Afterwards the <persName xml:id="10">Bp</persName>. thanked me warmly for my "magnificent" speech. Thus I finished what I suppose is my last public appearance as a beneficed priest in this diocese.</p>
