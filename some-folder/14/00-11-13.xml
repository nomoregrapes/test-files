         <p>A miserable wet day.  I spent most part of the morning in writing an Advent letter to the <orgName xml:id="9">Hospital</orgName> congregation.  <hi rend="bold">/</hi> In the afternoon I went to town, and attended Evensong at Westminster Abbey.  The singing was most beautiful.  <hi rend="bold underline">After service I called on <persName xml:id="44">Armitage Robinson</persName>. He shewed me over the house which is very large, rambling, &amp; costly to keep up</hi>.  He said <orgName xml:id="16">S. Margaret's</orgName> was worth &#x00A3;500 per annum.  He was very eager that my arrival should be hastened: &amp; alarmed me by the tidings that <hi rend="underline">all</hi> his curates were leaving, having been preferred to livings.  The music &amp; choir at S. Margaret's cost &#x00A3;1200 yearly.  This alarms me much.  On my return to Ilford, I wrote to <persName xml:id="87">M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> John Talbot</persName>, asking him whether he could by any means hasten the issue of the official announcement.  <hi rend="bold underline">I received an earnest letter from <persName xml:id="88">Jimmie Adderley</persName> begging me to persuade <persName xml:id="36">Lord S.</persName> to appoint him to this Hospital</hi>.</p>
