Then we all (except Bayne &amp; Tommie) <hi rend="b u">hurried off to Westminster, where I was duly installed in the Abbey as Canon</hi>. The quaint service is very solemn &amp; suggestive. After a brief chapter&#8211;meeting in which we discussed the Westminster Memorial Window, I returned to Ilford, &amp; tried to prepare a lecture: but my head ached badly, &amp; I had to lie down. Later I went to Great Ormond Street, &amp; dined with <persName id="78">Bedford</persName> at his Rectory, &amp; afterwards lectured at the <orgName id="12">Working Men's Institute</orgName> on <event id="5">â€˜The History of Preaching'</event>. The men listened very well &amp; seemed interested. Then accompanied by Bayne I returned to Ilford.</p>
