         <p>I wrote more letters, bringing the number of acknowledged congratulations to 166.  <hi rend="b u">Then I went to Westminster &amp; had an interview with my organist â€“ <persName id="50">Lemare</persName></hi><hi rend="b">.</hi>  In the Vestry a note was handed me from the Churchwarden inclosing a letter rather violently worded from a parishioner of importance protesting against the existing type &amp; time of the services.</p>
         <p>Then I walked to <placeName id="3">Bourdon House</placeName>, &amp; lunched with <persName id="46">Miss Leslie</persName>.

         <p>On my way home I purchased the book on the Temperance Question, wh. <persName id="49">Gore</persName> so earnestly commended.</p>
         <p><persName id="47">Willie Spencer</persName> brought me his photograph.</p>
