         <p>No less than 127 communicants came to the Sacrament at 8 a.m.: and 23 at 11 a.m.: making just 150 on my last Sunday of service here.  <persName id="100"><hi rend="u">Peabody</hi></persName>, from the Parish Church, ministered the Chalice.  <hi rend="u"><persName id="12">Nicholson</persName></hi> celebrated at 11 a.m.  I preached twice.  At 11 a.m. the Chapel was full, at 7 p.m. it was thronged, many failing to find admission.  <hi rend="b u">I preached "farewell" sermons, but the personal element was as far as possible kept out of view. There was emotion in the atmosphere, all kindly, which made preaching a trying task: but I got thro' it better than I hoped</hi>. The Churchwardens from Barking visited me in the afternoon: &amp; <persName id="75">Tommie</persName> &amp; <persName id="26">Bob</persName> had tea. <persName id="101">Fred Maisy</persName> came to supper.</p>

         <p><persName id="110">Hoskyns</persName>, the brother of the <persName id="111">Vicar of Bolton</persName>, was also dining.  An honest man to look at.
