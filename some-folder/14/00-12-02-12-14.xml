         <p>No less than 127 communicants came to the Sacrament at 8 a.m.: and 23 at 11 a.m.: making just 150 on my last Sunday of service here.  <persName id="100"><hi rend="u">Peabody</hi></persName>, from the Parish Church, ministered the Chalice.  <hi rend="u"><persName id="12">Nicholson</persName></hi> celebrated at 11 a.m.  I preached twice.  At 11 a.m. the Chapel was full, at 7 p.m. it was thronged, many failing to find admission.  <hi rend="b u">I preached "farewell" sermons, but the personal element was as far as possible kept out of view. There was emotion in the atmosphere, all kindly, which made preaching a trying task: but I got thro' it better than I hoped</hi>. The Churchwardens from Barking visited me in the afternoon: &amp; <persName id="75">Tommie</persName> &amp; <persName id="26">Bob</persName> had tea. <persName id="101">Fred Maisy</persName> came to supper.</p>

         <p>On <hi rend="u">Wednesday, the 5</hi><hi rend="sup u">th</hi><hi rend="u"> Dec</hi>., I attended service at the Abbey, &amp; then a Chapter Meeting at the Deanery. <persName id="108">M<hi rend="sup u">r</hi> Wheeler</persName> Q.C. attended to consult about the case of the Dean &amp; Chapter v. the new Borough of Westminster.<note id="8" n="1"></note></p>
         <p>
            <hi rend="i">The <persName id="109">Archdeacon</persName> asked me to dine, &amp; I did.  He gave not so much as the offer of wine. </hi>
         </p>
         <p><persName id="110">Hoskyns</persName>, the brother of the <persName id="111">Vicar of Bolton</persName>, was also dining.  An honest man to look at.  On my return, I found a letter from the <persName id="72">Archdeacon</persName>, announcing that he has accepted the Chaplaincy of the Hospital. <hi rend="u">Laus Deo</hi>.</p>

There was a large congregation on both occasions, especially in the morning.  <hi rend="b u">I read the Lessons from the Revised Version</hi>.<note id="9" n="2"></note></p>
         <p>On Wednesday, 12<hi rend="sup u">th</hi> Dec: I went to Chelmsford, and stayed to dine &amp; sleep at the Rectory, with the <persName id="10">Bishop</persName>.</p>
