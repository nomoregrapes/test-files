         <p>I attended a meeting of <orgName id="001">"Our Society"</orgName> at S. George's Rectory. <persName id="2">Osborne</persName>, Vicar of Seghill, gave an interesting address on <persName id="3">Father Hector</persName>. Afterwards I had some talk with <persName id="4">Donaldson</persName> who is going to India for a year. Then I went on to <orgName id="18">D<hi rend="sup u">r</hi> Williams's Library</orgName> in Gordon Square, and arranged to see the Baxter M.S.S. next Monday. <persName id="006">M<hi rend="sup u">rs</hi> Hirch</persName> brought the new Altar Cloth, a very beautiful piece of work, on which she &amp; certain skilful maidens have been engaged for some months.  Finally I wrote letters to <persName id="007">Alfred</persName>, <persName id="008">Albert Mason</persName>, <persName id="009">Collins</persName>, the <persName id="010">Bishop of S. Alban's</persName>, <persName id="011">Father Puller</persName>, <persName id="012">Nicholson</persName>, <persName id="013">Simpson</persName>, and <persName id="014">Raleigh</persName>. </p>
