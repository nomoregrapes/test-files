         <p>I attended a meeting of <orgName id="1">"Our Society"</orgName> at S. George's Rectory. <persName id="2">Osborne</persName>, Vicar of Seghill, gave an interesting address on <persName id="3">Father Hector</persName>. Afterwards I had some talk with <persName id="4">Donaldson</persName> who is going to India for a year. Then I went on to <orgName id="18">D<hi rend="sup u">r</hi> Williams's Library</orgName> in Gordon Square, and arranged to see the <persName id="5">Baxter</persName> M.S.S. next Monday. <persName id="6">M<hi rend="sup u">rs</hi> Hirch</persName> brought the new Altar Cloth, a very beautiful piece of work, on which she &amp; certain skilful maidens have been engaged for some months.  Finally I wrote letters to <persName id="7">Alfred</persName><note id="51" n="1"></note>, <persName id="8">Albert Mason</persName>, <persName id="9">Collins</persName>, the <persName id="10">Bishop of S. Alban's</persName>, <persName id="11">Father Puller</persName>, <persName id="12">Nicholson</persName>, <persName id="13">Simpson</persName>, and <persName id="14">Raleigh</persName>. </p>
