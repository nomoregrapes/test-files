         <p>As the news of my approaching departure from the <orgName id="9">Hospital</orgName> circulates, <hi rend="b u">the vultures of ambition scent the carcase of 'preferment'</hi>.  The post brought me a long letter from the <persName id="72">Archdeacon</persName> suggesting that the Hospital would just suit his case.  <persName id="73">Bayne</persName> of Little Ilford came to see me during the morning, and silently indicated an impression that he could fitly succeed me here.  <persName id="79">Trist</persName> came in the afternoon to ask my advice in the character of an avowed expectant.  This eagerness is rather nauseous.  </p>
         <p>I received a letter from <persName id="80">M<hi rend="sup u">r</hi> Mattinson</persName>, one of the Benchers of <orgName id="11">Gray's Inn</orgName>, sounding me about the Preachership there, vacant thro' <persName id="81">D<hi rend="sup u">r</hi> Lupton</persName>'s infirmity.  A few weeks ago I should have clutched at it: now I neither need nor care for it.  <hi rend="b u">May God help me to use rightly His new gift of prosperity! I dread this exhilaration &amp; uplifting of heart: what room is there for such sentiment in my present state? I have received an utterly underserved promotion, &amp; am called to a work quite beyond my powers. Have mercy on me, O God, &amp; enable what Thou dost demand</hi>.</p>
