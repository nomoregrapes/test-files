            <hi rend="b u">I travelled to Worcester in order to read a paper on <event id="1">'the Hist= of the Pastoral Ideal in the English Church'</event></hi> to the clergy.  I lunched with <persName id="1">Dean Forrest</persName>, a stately rather pompous dignitary, who showed me much courtesy.  The Deanery is a splendid building &#8211; full of interest.  The bulk of it is 14<hi rend="sup u">th</hi> century.  It was a Bishop's palace until 1841.  The Dean showed me his house, and the Cathedral with much pride.  There was but a meagre muster of clergy in the Chapter house.  I attended Evensong.  The Dean thanked me for <ref id="1">"Church Problems"</ref>: &amp;, <hi rend="b u">in conversation, said he wished the Gov</hi><hi rend="b sup u">t</hi> <hi rend="b u">w</hi><hi rend="b sup u">d</hi> <hi rend="b u">send me to Westminster.</hi>
            <hi rend="u">  So do I.</hi>: but I might as well wish for the moon.  I left Worcester about 5.30 p.m. &amp; reached Ilford shortly after 11 p.m.</p>
