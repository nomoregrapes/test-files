         <p>The morning post brought me a very kindly&#8211;expressed letter from <persName id="87">M<hi rend="sup u">r</hi> Talbot</persName>.  He undertakes to inquire into 'this strange &amp; unexplained delay': &amp; promises every assistance in his power to me as Rector.  For the rest I worried through the day wearily enough.  I am the worst <hi rend="u">waiter</hi> in the world.  M<hi rend="sup u">r</hi> Talbot speaks thus of my new position:&#8211;</p>

            <hi rend="i">'You have indeed a great place to fill, probably (short of the highest) there are none greater in the English Church &#8211; with the double duty of ministering to an important congregation (with a few really poor people) &amp; of taking part in the conduct of the Abbey, for which I see you share my enthusiasm'.</hi></div></p>

         <p>O God, the Holy Ghost, most blessed Comforter of Christian Souls, look with compassion on me at this time. I am so miserably bound by sin &amp; infirmity that I almost despair of myself. Vain exultation uplifts me at success, however undeserved, I dare to rejoice at the burden of new duties. Have mercy on me, &amp; visit my heart with Thy cleansing, consecrating graces. Give me humility and submission to Thy Will. Purify my motives, chasten &amp; restrain my ambitions, quicken my conscience, direct my understanding, kindle my heart. Come to me for guidance &amp; dedication. I give myself up to Thy government from this hour.</p>
         <p>Come, Holy Ghost, my soul inspire.<note id="7" n="2"></note>   </p>
