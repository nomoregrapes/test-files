         <p>I was in the Vestry preparing for the early Celebration, &amp; <persName xml:id="57">Clifford</persName> was ringing the bell, when <persName xml:id="15">Molony</persName> came in. He was evidently moved by strong emotion, &amp; said to me, "I would like to serve you: &amp; to receive the Sacrament with you". Of course I was delighted, &amp; welcomed him with eagerness: it was a trying ordeal to go thro' the service, but I was really very glad to be on Christian terms with him, &amp; I thought he was acting greatly.</p>
         <p>At 11 a.m. I preached &amp; <persName xml:id="12">Nicholson</persName> Celebrated. In the afternoon I had my <orgName xml:id="2">Chancellors</orgName>, &amp; we divided up S. John's Gospel for private reading. In the evening I <listEvent><event xml:id="90" display="no">preached</event></listEvent> at the newly&#8211;consecrated Church of S. Alban's in this parish. There was a crowded congregation, in which I recognized many members of the <orgName xml:id="9">Hospital</orgName> flock.</p>
