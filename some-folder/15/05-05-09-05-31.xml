<hi rend="i b u">I went to Oxford and read the Burial Service over <persName id="774">Harry Duff</persName></hi>. The first part of the service was taken in S. Mary's, the actual interment was in Holywell cemetery. I lunched in the Buttery with <persName id="251">Robertson</persName>, <persName id="776">Holland</persName>, <persName id="207">Goudy</persName>, &amp; <persName id="650">Smith</persName>.

<hi rend="b u">On Saturday, May 13</hi><hi rend="b sup u">th</hi><hi rend="b u"> 1905, we went to <orgName id="58">Eton</orgName>.</hi>  <persName id="541">Alington</persName> &amp; <persName id="775">Bowlby</persName> with their <persName id="777">wives</persName> came to dinner. The next day, Sunday, 14<hi rend="sup">th</hi> May, I received the Holy Communion in the school chapel at 8 a.m.  Then I preached to the boys at Mattins: after which <persName id="203">Warre</persName> took me for a walk.  I lunched in Hall, &amp; afterwards visited the Library with <persName id="778">Warre-Cornish</persName>.  Then I walked to the <placeName id="15">Castle</placeName>, &amp; called at the Deanery.  After this I attended service in <orgName id="59">S. George's Chapel</orgName>.  My wife joined me at the Deanery for tea.  On our way back we called at Bowlby's, &amp; saw his children.  Dinner at 8 p.m.  Edmond Warre arrived from Venice, &amp; after the ladies had retired showed us the sketches he had made in Sicily.  <hi rend="b u">We returned to Westminster on Monday 15</hi><hi rend="b sup u">th</hi><hi rend="b u"> May</hi>: in time for me to baptize in <orgName id="16">S. Margaret's</orgName>, <persName id="780">William George Hood</persName>, grandson of <persName id="779">Sir W<hi rend="sup u">m</hi> Walrond</persName>, until lately the Government Whip.  After the service, I lunched at 39 Park Lane.

         <p>On May 28<hi rend="sup u">th</hi> 1905, Rogation Sunday, the <persName id="721">Dean of Wells</persName> preached in S. Margaret's for the <persName id="166">Bishop of London</persName>'s Fund.  A poor sermon, and the worst offertory on record.  After service <persName id="195">Sir George Bartley</persName> K.C.B. came &amp; looked at <persName id="104">Kempe</persName>'s plans, &amp; promised a donation of &#x00A3;20.0.0.  The Bishop of London preached in the Abbey; I went to hear him, and, after service, <persName id="284">Sir John Wolfe Barry</persName> looked at the plans, &amp; walked round to the church.  He makes certain suggestions, which I must consider.  </p>
         <p>At Evensong the congregation was small and of the Holiday-making type.  <persName id="41">Harry Davis</persName> was in Church, and came in afterwards to supper.  <persName id="782">Miss Nora Ballard</persName> and her <persName id="783">brother</persName> also were here.</p>
         <p>Lord, save Thy servant for in Thee do I put my trust.</p>
         <p>Note: <hi rend="b u">on this day the Japanese destroyed the great Russian Armada. The news was rumoured &amp; whispered here during the afternoon.<note id="41" n="1"></note></hi>
