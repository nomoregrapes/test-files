<hi rend="b">Palm Sunday, April 16</hi><hi rend="b sup u">th</hi><hi rend="b">, 1905.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>A mild and brilliant morning. 36 comm<hi rend="sup u">ts</hi> at 8 a.m.</p>
         <p>There was a large congregation at Mattins, which, however, included a large infusion of holiday trippers.  In the Parl<hi rend="sup u">y</hi> seats I noticed <persName id="339">Sir Robert Finlay</persName>, &amp; <persName id="193">Sir Michael Hicks Beach</persName>, besides a good many other members of Parl<hi rend="sup u">t</hi>. There were 34 comm<hi rend="sup u">ts</hi> at the late celebration.  The weather had changed for the worse by the time the service was ended, &amp; rain had begun to fall.  About 3 p.m. there was a thunder-storm, after which rain fell quietly.</p>
         <p><persName id="560">Admiral Rolfe</persName> came to call during the afternoon.</p>
         <p>There was a fair congregation at Evensong; I preached on "Service", and concluded my sermon with some observations about the observance of Good Friday.</p>
         <p><persName id="489">Sherwood</persName>'s <persName id="646"><persName id="2009">two brothers</persName></persName>, <persName id="661">Waddell</persName>, <persName id="688">Gace</persName>, <persName id="467">Chart</persName> &amp; <persName id="113">Harold</persName> came in to supper.</p>
