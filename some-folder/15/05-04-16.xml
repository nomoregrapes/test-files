         </p>
         <p>A mild and brilliant morning. 36 comm<hi rend="superscript underline">ts</hi> at 8 a.m.</p>
         <p>There was a large congregation at Mattins, which, however, included a large infusion of holiday trippers.  In the Parl<hi rend="superscript underline">y</hi> seats I noticed <persName xml:id="339">Sir Robert Finlay</persName>, &amp; <persName xml:id="193">Sir Michael Hicks Beach</persName>, besides a good many other members of Parl<hi rend="superscript underline">t</hi>. There were 34 comm<hi rend="superscript underline">ts</hi> at the late celebration.  The weather had changed for the worse by the time the service was ended, &amp; rain had begun to fall.  About 3 p.m. there was a thunder-storm, after which rain fell quietly.</p>
         <p><persName xml:id="560">Admiral Rolfe</persName> came to call during the afternoon.</p>
         <p>There was a fair congregation at Evensong; I preached on "Service", and concluded my sermon with some observations about the observance of Good Friday.</p>
