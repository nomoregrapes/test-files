         <p>This has been an ill-spent day.  I started a sermon, &amp; then called on <persName id="208">Beeching</persName>, who gave me a copy of the volume of <persName id="103">Ainger</persName>'s <ref id="56">Sermons</ref> he has edited.  I walked the Embankment as usual, &amp; read a novel <ref id="57">"The terrible Tsar"</ref>.  In the evening there was a meeting of the <orgName id="41">Guild</orgName>.</p>
         <p>Reading:-</p>
         <p><persName id="639">Hacket</persName>'s <ref id="54">Life of Williams</ref></p>
