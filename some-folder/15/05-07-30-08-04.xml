         <p>The sun shines gloriously after a hot might, and there is a slight breeze. I read <persName id="716">Harnack</persName>'s <ref id="62">new volume</ref> for awhile before getting up. In the Abbey there was a very large congregation. It was Election Sunday, and the School attended in force, and received the Holy Communion. <persName id="120">Strong</persName> of Ch. Ch. preached a pleasant sermon. My Godson, <persName id="7">Alfred</persName>, came to see me.  <persName id="695">Herbert Gritten</persName> also came to tea &amp; supper. I preached to a very large congregation in the Abbey at 3 p.m., &amp; again to a moderate assembly at 7 p.m. in <orgName id="16">S. Margaret's</orgName>. This is the last occasion on which the present aspect of the East End will be apparent.</p>

It was an ideal dinner party, &amp; we talked hard. It was odd to see the political antagonists at what is a bitter crisis affectionately familiar. It was ‘Arthur' and ‘Henry'. We had a great religious argument. Afterwards the P.M. carried me home in his motor.  He was </hi><hi rend="i u">fascinating</hi><hi rend="i">.</hi>
