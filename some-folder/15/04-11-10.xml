         <p>I walked round to the Almshouses &amp; had a talk with <persName xml:id="156"><hi rend="underline">Fedarb</hi></persName>: on my way I left a note on the <persName xml:id="560">Admiral</persName>.  Both churchwardens agreed to my scheme very readily.  <hi rend="italic bold underline"><persName xml:id="113">Harold</persName> is to be their clerk for a period of one year at a stipend of &#x00A3;30 per annum.  They will pay &#x00A3;10 a year to <persName xml:id="121">Custard</persName> to teach him music</hi><hi rend="italic">.</hi>			
         </p>
         <p>Then I attended a meeting of the aforesaid Convocation Committee: and from that went off to the <orgName xml:id="158">Hunt Memorial Committee</orgName>: where we decided to attempt to raise funds for the renovation of the East End.</p>
         <p>On the Embankment I fell in, first, with the <persName xml:id="166">Bishop of London</persName>, with whom I walked amicably some while, next, with the Admiral.</p>
         <p>My <persName xml:id="112">wife</persName> &amp; I dined with <persName xml:id="643">Sir Henry Lawrence</persName> in the <orgName xml:id="49" display="no">Inner Temple</orgName>. <persName xml:id="319">George Prothero</persName> was there.</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="italic"><persName xml:id="642">Sir Peile Thompson</persName> called on me this afternoon, and had some conversation with me.  He was in <orgName xml:id="16">S. Margaret's</orgName> on Sunday morning, &amp; came into the vestry to request acquaintance afterwards.  He was once a curate of <persName xml:id="644">Llewelyn Davies</persName>.</hi>
