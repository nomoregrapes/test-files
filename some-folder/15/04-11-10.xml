<hi rend="b">Thursday, November 10</hi><hi rend="b sup u">th</hi><hi rend="b">, 1904.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>I walked round to the Almshouses &amp; had a talk with <persName id="156"><hi rend="u">Fedarb</hi></persName>: on my way I left a note on the <persName id="560">Admiral</persName>.  Both churchwardens agreed to my scheme very readily.  <hi rend="i b u"><persName id="113">Harold</persName> is to be their clerk for a period of one year at a stipend of &#x00A3;30 per annum.  They will pay &#x00A3;10 a year to <persName id="121">Custard</persName> to teach him music</hi><hi rend="i">.</hi>			
         </p>
         <p>Then I attended a meeting of the aforesaid <orgName id="48">Convocation Committee</orgName>: and from that went off to the <orgName id="158">Hunt Memorial Committee</orgName>: where we decided to attempt to raise funds for the renovation of the East End.</p>
         <p>On the Embankment I fell in, first, with the <persName id="166">Bishop of London</persName>, with whom I walked amicably some while, next, with the Admiral.</p>
         <p>My <persName id="112">wife</persName> &amp; I dined with <persName id="643">Sir Henry Lawrence</persName> in the <orgName id="49">Inner Temple</orgName>. <persName id="319">George Prothero</persName> was there.</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="i"><persName id="642">Sir Peile Thompson</persName> called on me this afternoon, and had some conversation with me.  He was in <orgName id="16">S. Margaret's</orgName> on Sunday morning, &amp; came into the vestry to request acquaintance afterwards.  He was once a curate of <persName id="644">Llewelyn Davies</persName>.</hi>
