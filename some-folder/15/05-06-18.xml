         <p>18 years ago I was ordained in Cuddesdon Church.</p>
         <p>What have I done? and what have I become?</p>
         <p>"God be merciful to me, the Sinner".</p>
         <p>I celebrated at 8 a.m.; when there were 37 communicants.</p><div type="verse">

         <p>There was a large congregation, mainly composed of tourists, at Mattins. I preached on Rom. I. 16 &amp; my MS. was filched from me by a reporter.</p>

         <p>Accompanied by <persName id="113">Harold</persName>, I went to S. James's Clerkenwell, and <event id="136">preached</event> to the <orgName id="53">Watch &amp; Clock-Makers' Pension Society</orgName>. It was the occasion of their annual Sermon, and the <persName id="742">Mayor</persName> &amp; <orgName id="54">Corporation of Finsbury</orgName> attended in state. I preached for 32 minutes from the text, 1.Tim.V. 8.</p>
         <p>I preached again at Evensong.</p>
