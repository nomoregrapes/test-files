         <p>18 years ago I was ordained in Cuddesdon Church.</p>
         <p>What have I done? and what have I become?</p>
         <p>"God be merciful to me, the Sinner".</p>
         <p>I celebrated at 8 a.m.; when there were 37 communicants.</p><div type="verse">

         <p>There was a large congregation, mainly composed of tourists, at Mattins. I preached on Rom. I. 16 &amp; my MS. was filched from me by a reporter.</p>
