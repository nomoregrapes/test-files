         <p>A wet morning.  As I had to celebrate in the Abbey later in the day I did not go to <orgName id="16">S. Margaret's</orgName> before breakfast, but occupied myself in finishing my sermon.</p>
         <p>
<persName id="722"><hi rend="du">D</hi><hi rend="sup doubleunderline">r</hi><hi rend="du"> Clark</hi></persName> arrived while we were still at breakfast.  He preached a pleasing sermon on Isaiah LXI. 1. "Beauty for ashes".  I celebrated as the <persName id="44">Dean</persName> was absent.</p>
         <p>In the afternoon I <event id="143">preached</event> in the Abbey on "Oppression and Justice", making reference to <persName id="723">Guy Fawkes</persName> and <persName id="724">Dutch William</persName>, and turning the tables <hi rend="u">more meo</hi> on the Protestant Fanatics.  After service an Irish clergyman (<hi rend="du"><persName id="725">Rev. Phinehas Hunt</persName></hi>) and an Irish doctor came to the house to protest!!  No doubt things are bad in Ireland.  There was one angry &amp; audible interruption during the sermon.</p>
         <p>I preached in <orgName id="16">S. Margaret's</orgName> at Evensong.  Considering the weather there was a fair congregation.  My text was Amos III. 1,2, and my subject "National Privilege &amp; National duty".  <persName id="121">Custard</persName> came in to supper afterwards.</p>
