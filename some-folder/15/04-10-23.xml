         <p>It was raining despondently when I went to church at 8 a.m: and there were only 15 communicants.  I preached to a moderate congregation, which included the <persName xml:id="325">Bishop of Winchester</persName> &amp; <persName xml:id="326">M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Ryle</persName>.  It was a curious coincidence that I quoted the Bishop by name.  He came to lunch afterwards, &amp; was extremely pleasant.  <persName xml:id="274">Charles</persName> &amp; <persName xml:id="570">Edith Bruce</persName> also came.</p>
         <p><persName xml:id="635">Lloyd-Williams</persName>'s young men, to the number of five, came to discuss the possibilities of a Bible-class; but I don't think there's much prospect of anything. </p>
         <p>In the evening, though the rain was falling, there was a large congregation.  I preached again on the Book of Daniel.  The Offertory amounted to &#x00A3;7.17.7. </p>
         <p>
<hi rend="underline"><persName xml:id="484">Willie White</persName></hi> came to me after service: &amp; I said that his father must send me a letter authorising his friendship with <persName xml:id="331">A.R</persName>.</p>
         <p>I wrote to <persName xml:id="560">Admiral Rolfe</persName>. </p>
