         <p>My Birthday falls again on Sunday.  The last occasion when that conjunction occurred was in 1896 when <persName id="83">my Father</persName> died at Ilford while I was <event id="11">preaching</event> to the University at Oxford.  The seven years since that dark day have brought many changes and no happiness.  <hi rend="b u">At forty one really has left youth &amp; hope behind: and has no margin of time or faith left for ventures or surprises.  The type, scale, quality, range of one's life are all discovered: and whatever may be the number of years left to one, they are not likely seriously to affect the final verdict.</hi>  At best one can but correct a few false impressions, rectify a few blunders, add something to the sum total of work done: and, if this be granted, one is fortunate. What a holocaust of desires &amp; day-dreams has been made in the last 12 months even! Truly this world is a comfortless place, which it were joy to leave. Yet I doubt not that to the common view, I have the aspect of a prosperous man, a subject of envious regard, enviable &amp; envied! </p>

         </p>
         <p>There was a large congregation at Mattins, and the <persName id="130">Bishop of Stepney</persName> preached an excellent &amp; effective sermon.  I read the lessons &amp; (the first time for a very long while) the Litany.  The Offertory exceeded &#x00A3;67. Among the congregation was the <persName id="173">Bishop of Bath &amp; Wells</persName>, <persName id="230">Renshaw</persName>, &amp; <persName id="195">Bartley</persName>. Females preponderated fearfully.</p>
         <p><persName id="98">M<hi rend="sup u">r</hi></persName> &amp; <persName id="616">M<hi rend="sup u">rs</hi> Hunt</persName> lunched here: and the three curates; afterwards I walked for an hour.</p>
         <p><persName id="75">Tommie Hall</persName>, <persName id="293">Edwin</persName>, &amp; <persName id="113">Harold</persName> came to tea.</p>
         <p>I preached at Evensong to a large congregation. <persName id="117">Rashdall</persName> was in church, and came to supper afterwards.</p>

         <p>Nov: 10. 1903</p>
         <p>Dear M<hi rend="sup u">r</hi> Jacks,</p>
         <p>I have not forgotten my pledge to the Hibbert Journal, and, indeed, have been thinking over the articles in Enc. Bib: which are of very great importance, &amp; need to be digested. It occurred to me that it w<hi rend="sup u">d</hi> be suitable in itself, convenient to me, and perhaps not inconvenient to you, if that article appeared in the April issue of the H.J. which of course wd. be the Easter issue.</p>
         <p>I meditate turning my mind resolutely on to the subject of the Resurrection during Lent, &amp; probably of preaching a course on that subject in the Abbey Pulpit: &amp; and I sh<hi rend="sup u">d</hi> personally prefer that what I wrote to the H.J. sh<hi rend="sup u">d</hi> have behind it the most cautious &amp; well-informed thought, it is in my power to give.</p>
         <p>Believe me,</p>
         <p>Sincerely yrs.</p>

         <p>Dec. 21<hi rend="sup u">st</hi>. 1903</p>
         <p>Dear D<hi rend="sup u">r</hi> Hunter,</p>
         <p>I have to ask your pardon for not answering before the very kind letter which you were good enough to address to me, and thanking you for a little book, of which I have already read enough to see that I shall find in it much pleasure and profit. Frankly, my first disposition of mind on receiving your invitation to preach in your church was to return a prompt acceptance: and if, on reflection, I must decide to send you a very reluctant refusal, I shall ask you to believe that my decision is determined by no personal unwillingness to do what you have been good enough to ask, and by no doubt as to my legal right so to do, but simply by considerations of expediency. I fear that, just now, when, as seems not improbable, I shall have to stand the brunt of a very sharp conflict with prevailing Anglican sentiment on the matter raised by Bishop <persName id="49">Gore</persName>, my coming to you might have the effect of weakening my hands, and of putting weapons <hi rend="b">[266]</hi> into the hands of my opponents. I shall trespass so far on the good feeling which you have expressed towards me, as to ask you to renew your invitation presently, when circumstances may be more kindly, and the legitimate effect of my public association with you, on terms of frank ministerial equality, might not run the risk of being prejudiced in the Anglican mind.</p>
         <p>With every assurance of esteem and all good wishes for this holy Christmas time, both for yourself and for the extensive and important Christian work which you are carrying on,</p>
         <p>I am,</p>
         <p>most sincerely yours,</p>
         <p>H. Hensley Henson</p></div>

         <p>On Friday, Dec: 18<hi rend="sup u">th</hi> 1903 I lunched with <persName id="398">Morrison</persName> at the <orgName id="44">Reform Club</orgName>, and discussed the <persName id="496">Beeby</persName> case.<note id="29" n="1"></note>  He shewed me some letters of Beeby's to an intimate friend giving, with the freedom of friendship, an account of his interviews with <persName id="49">Gore</persName>.  These letters impressed me favourably, and I forthwith determined to preach plainly on the matter.  <hi rend="b u">Accordingly I wrote a sermon which I read over to <persName id="62">Kirshbaum</persName> &amp; to <persName id="208">Beeching</persName>, &amp; made some alterations on their suggestions.</hi>  This <event id="12">sermon</event> was preached in <orgName id="16">S. Margaret's</orgName> on Dec: 20<hi rend="sup u">th</hi>, a précis was sent to the <ref id="30">"<hi rend="i">Times</hi>"</ref> and appeared on the 21<hi rend="sup u">st</hi>; this was almost wholly reproduced in the <ref id="31"><hi rend="i">Westminster Gazette</hi> the same day</ref>.  On the following day, I <hi rend="i">received a letter from the <persName id="128">Abp. Of Canterbury</persName> which decided me </hi><hi rend="i b u">not</hi><hi rend="i"> to publish my sermon, or to ask Beeby to preach in the Abbey. </hi>
