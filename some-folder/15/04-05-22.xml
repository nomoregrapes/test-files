         <p>A cold day threatening rain!</p>
         <p>I celebrated at 8 a.m. There were 72 comm<hi rend="sup">ts</hi>. At the choral celebration there was by no means a large congregation, which however was perhaps not unconnected with the darkening aspect of the sky. I preached depressingly: there were 136 communicants.  <hi rend="i b u">An American clergyman, named <persName id="569">Lloyd</persName>, who hails from Seattle</hi><hi rend="i"> in the state of Washington, came into the Vestry after the early celebration, and afterwards lunched with me.  He was an interesting &amp; intelligent man.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>I walked down the Embankment, &amp; left some portion of my discourse at the Times Office. </p>
         <p>At Evensong there was a fair congregation.  I preached a sermon written as long ago as 1898.  <persName id="156">Fedarb</persName> took his place in the Churchwarden's seat.</p>
         <p><persName id="570">Edith Bruce</persName> &amp; <persName id="571">Geordie Gore</persName> came to supper.</p>

         <p>On Wednesday, May 25<hi rend="sup u">th</hi>, <persName id="112">Ella</persName> and I went to Cambridge to visit the <persName id="574"><persName id="573">Burkitts</persName></persName>, and stayed until Friday night, when we returned to <placeName id="5">Dean's Yard</placeName>; having enjoyed a pleasant visit with very hospitable, kind hosts.</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="i">I was interested to meet again <persName id="572">Kennett</persName>, now Regius Prof. of Hebrew, and Canon of Ely. I had not seen him for at least 21 years, and he had become, in the interval, unrecognizable.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>On Thursday <persName id="574">Burkitt</persName> took me to dine in Trinity; there I renewed acquaintance with <persName id="575">Jackson</persName>, one of the senior fellows. The Romans are much in evidence at Cambridge. I met <persName id="576">Dom: Butler</persName>, <persName id="577">Father Sutcliffe</persName>, <persName id="578">Father Nolan</persName>, and Ella met also <persName id="579">Father Barnes</persName>.  </p>
         <p>On Friday afternoon we went for a picnic up the river very pleasantly.</p>
