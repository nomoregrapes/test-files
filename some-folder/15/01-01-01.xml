         <p>The bells are ringing in the new Century.  I am standing on the threshold of new work.  The year, just ended will be always memorable to me, as bringing me this immense opportunity.  When I seemed at the very end of my earthly hopes, this great thing was given me.  <hi rend="b u">I had not sought it, it came to me as the most absolute of surprises</hi>.  To this hour, I have no knowledge whose good offices commended me to <persName id="31">Lord S</persName>.  This fact makes me adventure the belief that here I am <term id="51">'<hi rend="u">missus a Deo'</hi></term>.  And this faith has been strengthened by the extraordinary kindness which on all hands has been shown to me.  Here, I was welcomed most warmly, by everybody from the <persName id="99">Dean</persName> to the Choir-boys.  More than 200 letters of congratulation, from all sorts &amp; conditions of men, were sent to me, many of them expressed in very ardent terms.  The <term id="1">Socii</term>, as usual, were without exception affectionate.  <hi rend="b u">The newspapers, with the solitary exception of <ref id="89">"Truth"</ref>, were friendly</hi><hi rend="b">.</hi><note id="68" n="1"></note>  All this was very comforting, and in a real measure, strengthening.  Everybody seemed to be accepting me as <hi rend="u">missus a Deo</hi>.  Thus I face the tremendous responsibilities of this great place with many tokens of confidence, in audience of many voices of encouragement.  Yet I own to a <hi rend="b">[2]</hi> deep anxiety, almost a fear.  Can I, being what I know myself to be, do this work to which God has sent me?  "<hi rend="u">The grass withereth: the flower fadeth: but the Word of our God shall stand for ever</hi>." - the confidence which I may have must altogether rest on Him, whose servant I am. With what mind, then, do I dare to put my hand to this plough? I would be a penitent for the past - "<hi rend="u">I will confess my wickedness, &amp; be sorry for my sin</hi>" - for my amazing &amp; protracted unthankfulness, for my discontent, and egotism, and ambition, and manifold sin.  '<hi rend="u">God be merciful to me a sinner</hi>'. Then, I would be a Disciple, make an act of personal trust in my living Master &amp; Lord, Jesus Christ, give myself altogether into His keeping. "<hi rend="u">Lord, I believe: help Thou mine unbelief</hi>".  Finally, I would invoke the Comfort, guidance, purification, strength of the Holy Spirit - '<hi rend="u">Come, Holy Ghost, my soul inspire</hi>'. Thus I would adventure on this new &amp; difficult enterprize, entirely renouncing confidence in myself, and trusting wholly to the Grace of God. "<hi rend="u">Shew Thou me the way that I should walk in for I lift up my soul unto Thee"</hi>. "<hi rend="u">Father, into Thy Hands I commend my spirit</hi>."</p>

         <p>My work in the Abbey has begun this New Year's Day, when I began my month's Residence. The Dean being absent I Celebrated after Mattins. There were no less than 72 comm<hi rend="sup u">ts</hi>, including <persName id="177">Bishop Barry</persName>. </p>
         <p>In the afternoon I attended Evensong: <persName id="73">Bayne</persName> preached very excellently. <persName id="850">Bain</persName> called, and returned later with a picture which he had purchased for me. What an impulsive, affectionate creature he is! My Rural dean, <persName id="618">Northcote</persName>, who is <persName id="187">Farrar</persName>'s son in law called.</p>
