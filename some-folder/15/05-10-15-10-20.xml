         <p>A dull, windy day threatening rain.  I celebrated at 8 a.m. Among the communicants was <persName id="413">Reichel</persName>, who came in to breakfast.</p>
         <p>Congregations were unsatisfactory both at Mattins and at Evensong.  The evening turned out wet, &amp; this may explain the latter, but the morning remains unexplained.  I was told that it was "Temperance Sunday", &amp; – as it is fairly well known that I ignore all "fancy calendars" – it is possible that there was a secession to S. John's, where the <persName id="109">Archdeacon</persName> preached twice.</p>
         <p><persName id="661">Waddell</persName>, <persName id="756">Gage</persName>, &amp; <persName id="28">Dick Rosser</persName> came in to supper. </p>
         <p>

         </p>
         <p>I attended the consecration of <persName id="532">D<hi rend="sup u">r</hi> Chase</persName> as the new Bishop of Ely on S. Luke's day. The <persName id="757">Master of Trinity</persName> preached a fine sermon.</p>
         <p>On Friday, the 20<hi rend="sup u">th</hi> Oct: 1905, <hi rend="du"><persName id="754">Sir Henry Irving</persName></hi> was buried in Poet's Corner, with much ceremony.  The <persName id="44">Dean</persName> emerged at the beginning &amp; at the ending of the service. The <persName id="296">Sub-Dean</persName> read the Lesson &amp; the Committal; &amp; the Archdeacon read the concluding prayers.  When the procession was returning, &amp; the ‘Dead March' had just ceased on the organ<hi rend="b u">, there was heard a cry of some Fanatical Anti-Dramatist, "Whatever a man soweth that shall he also reap".</hi>
         </p>
         <p>This is the anniversary of my marriage.  Three years have passed since in the Abbey I took that gravest of all decisive acts, &amp; am still wondering dismally whether it was for me in any respect a legitimate action.</p>
         <p>Note:- My <persName id="112">wife</persName> went off again to Scotland on the 19<hi rend="sup u">th</hi> October.</p>
