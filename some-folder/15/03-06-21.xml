         <p>I did not get up for the early Communion, feeling doubtful of my physical resources for the day's work.  At Mattins there was a large congregation and I preached a long sermon with great discomfort to myself, &amp; great weariness for the people.  I spake decisively as to my own attitude towards the so-called â€˜inspiration' of the Bible.  The Offertory exceeded &#x00A3;<hi rend="underline">20</hi>.</p>
         <p>At Evensong there was again a great crowd, and I preached an old sermon of some length.  The Offertory exceeded &#x00A3;8.</p>
