<hi rend="i">This day is set for the celebration of the 1300</hi><hi rend="i superscript">th</hi><hi rend="i"> anniversary of the Bishop</hi><hi rend="i bold">^rick^</hi><hi rend="i"> of London[</hi><hi rend="i bold strikethrough">'s Fund</hi><hi rend="i">], and also for the annual collections for the Bishop's <orgName id="132">Fund</orgName>.  I have prepared a long </hi><hi rend="i u">historical</hi><hi rend="i"> sermon for the morning, and a more directly </hi><hi rend="i u">mendicant</hi><hi rend="i"> discourse for the evening.  It is the first occasion on which I myself have preached in <orgName id="16">S. Margaret's</orgName> on this Sunday: and now </hi><hi rend="i b u">I do so heavily suspected of all kinds of fatal heresies</hi><hi rend="i">, and, for some weeks past, the object of insult &amp; denunciation, public &amp; private. It is strange to what fortunes we are surrendered, &amp; to what unexpected ends we move.</hi>  <hi rend="i b u">More &amp; more I am persuaded that my life is governed by a Higher Power, and that I move along pre-ordained lines towards pre-determined ends: &amp; yet I am not fatalist because, along with this, I am more &amp; more impressed with a haunting fear of personal failure to answer to the calls &amp; plans of God</hi><hi rend="i">.  Yet can I in no way reconcile these conflicting convictions.  To be a Man of destiny, a straw on the stream of Divine Purpose, is one thing: to be a disobedient &amp; self-willed servant, is another.  Yet I know myself to be </hi><hi rend="i doubleunderline">both</hi><hi rend="i">.</hi>
