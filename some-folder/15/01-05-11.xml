<hi rend="italic">I know not what cloud is upon me: but all this week I have been black in soul. Why this intolerable discontent? The days drift by while I gnaw my soul.</hi>  <hi rend="italic">It is as absurd as it is un-Christian. Certainly I grow more perplexed daily about the parish.</hi>  <hi rend="italic">There are very few poor people now left in it, perhaps not more than 300.</hi>  <hi rend="italic">Of well-to-do residents the number rapidly diminishes: &amp; most of the Parliament folk live out of the parish.</hi>  <hi rend="italic">And at best these are but resident half the year.</hi>  <hi rend="italic">Then the modern fashion of going out for week-ends confuses our work still more.</hi>  <hi rend="italic">Parochially this is a small &amp; unsatisfactory sphere: but, of course, there are other aspects.</hi>         </p>
