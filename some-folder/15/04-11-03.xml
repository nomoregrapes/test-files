         <p>While the college were debating the merits of the candidates, <persName id="548">Hardinge</persName> &amp; I went a pleasant walk round the Parks.  Then I went to Walford &amp; Spokes &amp; <hi rend="b u">purchased a piece of plate &amp; a horn tumbler, as gifts to <persName id="112">my wife</persName></hi>.  <persName id="222">Albert Saxton</persName> lunched with me in the buttery, &amp; took me a good walk down the river-bank, by Iffley, thro' Hinksey &amp; so back to college.  There <persName id="14">Raleigh</persName> &amp; I walked out to the Banbury R<hi rend="sup u">d</hi>, &amp; had tea with <persName id="649">M<hi rend="sup u">rs</hi> Dicey</persName>.  <persName id="650">Smith</persName> of Balliol, &amp; <persName id="651">Barrington-Ward</persName> of Hertford, were elected Fellows, &amp; we drank their health at dinner.  Then I gathered my bags from the <persName id="228">Warden</persName>'s lodgings, &amp; returned to Westminster, arriving about 11.30 p.m.</p>
         <p>Just 20 years ago I myself was elected to a fellowship at All Souls: &amp; 4 years ago on this day I received <persName id="36">Lord Salisbury</persName>'s letter offering me this fateful Canonry. </p>
