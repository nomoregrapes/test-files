         <p>After Evensong I called at 67 Cornwall Road to see <persName id="537"><hi rend="b u">Robartes</hi></persName>, who - as the <persName id="228">Warden</persName> had informed me - was dying, &amp; desired to see me.  I did see him, &amp; we exchanged some converse, but I was unwell, &amp; the atmosphere of a Roman â€˜conversion' dismayed me.  He asked me to return, &amp; I told his <persName id="544">wife</persName> that I would do so if she told me I might.  Robartes himself is clearly being brought into the true fold by the accustomed means.</p>
         <p>On Sunday I was too ill to preach either in the Abbey or in <orgName id="16">S. Margaret's</orgName>. <persName id="208">Beeching</persName> took my place in the one pulpit, <persName id="62">Kirshbaum</persName> in the other.</p>
