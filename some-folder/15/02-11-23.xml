         <p>Feeling rheumatic I did not get to Church for the early Celebration. At Mattins I preached to a moderate congregation, on S. James. II.17.  The offertory was &#x00A3;17.17.5.  Accompanied by <persName id="293">Edwin Saxton</persName>, I drove to All Saints, Tufnell Park, and <event id="100">preached</event> for the local hospital.  The <persName id="166">Bishop of London</persName> was preaching at the same hour in an adjacent church, so that my congregation was <hi rend="u">not</hi> crowded.  Returning to Westminster, I preached again in <orgName id="16">S. Margaret's</orgName>.  There was a good congregation: the Offertory = &#x00A3;16.11.5. After supper, I had a hot bath, and went to bed.</p>
