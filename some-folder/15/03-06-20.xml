<hi rend="i"><persName id="62">Kirshbaum</persName> dined with me, <persName id="112">my wife</persName> being absent, and, after dinner, </hi><hi rend="i b u">confided in me his intention of marrying <persName id="450">Miss Nichol</persName>.</hi> I think he will do wisely.  I wrote to the young lady in congratulation, &amp; to <persName id="433">Archdeacon Wilson</persName> asking him to appoint Kirshbaum to the vacant living of S. James, Rochdale, which is in his gift.  Thus I have in front of me serious changes.  Kirshbaum, and <persName id="170">Perkins</persName> will have left:  <persName id="282">Campbell</persName> is helpless.</p>
