         <p>A warm, wet day.  I went to <orgName id="16">S. Margaret's</orgName> at 8 a.m., and celebrated the Holy Communion.  Before the Prayer for the Church Militant, I called for prayers for <persName id="282">Frank Campbell</persName>.  He went under an operation yesterday, and is seriously ill.  There were but 14 communicants.</p>
         <p>At Mattins, the <persName id="297">Precentor</persName> preached, &amp; <persName id="456">Blackmore</persName> sang the service.  I remained indoors and revised for use two old sermons, there having been no time this week to write fresh ones.</p>
         <p><persName id="227">Murray</persName> came to lunch.</p>
         <p>There was a large congregation in the Abbey at 3 p.m. I <event id="147">preached</event> from Psalm. XVII. 18.</p>
         <p>The weather deteriorated as the evening drew on, and I went to S. Margaret's for Evensong through rain at [sic] storm.  In spite of the elements a considerable congregation assembled; I preached from S. Matthew VI. 24; and at the conclusion of my sermon asked that names of Confirmation Candidates should be sent in.</p>
         <p>Murray, <persName id="121">Custard</persName>, and <persName id="300">Ellison</persName> came to supper.</p>
