         <p>I attain the age of 39 years today - much battered &amp; perplexed.  <hi rend="b u">The morning was spent in writing to the <ref id="14">'Times'</ref> in answer to <persName id="49">Gore</persName>'s letter, which appeared this morning</hi>. In the afternoon I took <persName id="62">S. K.</persName> for a walk: &amp; then went to the <orgName id="32">Choir School</orgName> with <persName id="112">my wife</persName>, &amp; distributed cake &amp; sixpenny-bits to the choir-boys.  <persName id="308">Hobhouse</persName> called: he seems to sympathize with Gore's attitude more than so wise looking a man might be expected to do.  <hi rend="b u">The 'Pilot' appeared for the last time this morning.<note id="18" n="1"></note>  A ritualist venture defunct for lack of support: very ably written in the main, but ecclesiastically wrongheaded always.</hi>
