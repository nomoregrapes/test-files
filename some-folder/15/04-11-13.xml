         <p>A fog tending to grow denser.  I celebrated at 8 a.m: there were 21 communicants.  The <persName id="166">Bishop of London</persName> preached in the Abbey for the <orgName id="145">East London Church Fund</orgName>, &amp; I expected no congregation in <orgName id="16">S. Margaret's</orgName>. But there seemed no appreciable diminution: &amp; among those present were <persName id="539">Alf. Lyttelton</persName> &amp; <persName id="645">Sir Courtenay Ilbert</persName>.</p>
         <p>At 4 p.m. I preached to the <orgName id="45">Church Lads Brigade</orgName> in S. Margaret's.  <persName id="113">Harold</persName> accompanied me to S. Philip's Stepney - a remarkably fine church - where I <event id="128">preached</event> to a congregation largely consisting of the nurses from the London Hospital.</p>
