         <p>A sultry and tiring day. I celebrated at 8 a.m. There were 37 communicants. At Mattins the congregation was fidgety and tourist. I preached on Lord's Day Observance with much discomfort, and amid many signs of congregational disrelish! Among the congregation were <persName xml:id="214">Dean Fremantle</persName>, <persName xml:id="696">Sir John Dorington</persName>, <persName xml:id="230">Sir C. Renshaw</persName>, <persName xml:id="677">Sir Elliott Lees</persName>, but mostly the M.Ps were absent.</p>
         <p>There were 56 comm<hi rend="superscript underline">ts</hi> at the late celebration.</p>
         <p><persName xml:id="113">Harold</persName> and I walked round the bridges after luncheon, and had much converse on the subject of the morning's preaching.</p>
         <p>At 7 p.m. I <listEvent><event xml:id="135" display="no">preached</event></listEvent> in the Abbey to a very large congregation. It was the opening of the Nave Services for the year. My subject was again "Lord's Day Observance", and in the course of a long sermon, I took occasion to speak strongly on the desecrating influence of the Sunday motorists.</p>
