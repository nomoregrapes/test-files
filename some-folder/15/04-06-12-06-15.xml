         <p>A dull and chilly morning symbolic of the temper of the world when the appeal of Charity is made to it.  I celebrated at 8 a.m.  There were 30 communicants.</p>
         <p>At Mattins there seemed but a moderate congregation.  The Offertory exceeded &#x00A3;102.0.0.  I preached from S. John XIX.26.27.</p>
         <p>I preached at Evensong in Christ Church, Lancaster Gate.  <persName id="178">Ridgeway</persName> preached for me in <orgName id="16">S. Margaret's</orgName>.</p>

         <p>I showed her over the Abbey, which she appreciated.  She read, apparently with interest, &amp; certainly with many professions of approval, <hi rend="b u">both the <ref id="15">Hibbert</ref> &amp; the <ref id="33">Contemporary Articles</ref></hi>.</p>
