         <p>When I turned over my "Times" at breakfast I was surprised by a melancholy announcement.  <hi rend="b u"><persName id="317">Arthur Cuthbert Medd</persName>, whom, a year ago, we elected to a Fellowship at <orgName id="7">All Souls</orgName> is dead from typhoid fever</hi>. He was only 24, and I was just getting to be really fond of him. It is very saddening &amp; minatory. I wrote to <persName id="318">M<hi rend="sup u">r</hi> Justice Ridley</persName>, his uncle, at whose house he died.</p>
