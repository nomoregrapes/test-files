         <p><persName id="371">M<hi rend="sup u">r</hi> Howland</persName> of the "Outlook" interviewed me at 10 a.m. about the 'passive resistance' campaign.<note id="101" n="1"></note></p>
         <p>The Chapter meeting occupied the whole morning up to lunch time. There were no breezes, in spite of the omens overnight. We gave the <persName id="297">Precentor</persName> leave to go to South Africa for six months to join in an Anglican Mission.</p>
         <p>In the after noon [sic] <persName id="112">Ella</persName> &amp; I went, at <persName id="98">M<hi rend="sup u">r</hi> Hunt</persName>'s invitation, to the <orgName id="36">Masonic School</orgName> at Clapham. The skill &amp;c of the girls was excellent.</p>
         <p>On our return I walked for an hour with <persName id="216">Gow</persName>, who seems discontented with the plans for the new buildings.  </p>
         <p>After dinner, <persName id="293">Edwin</persName> came &amp; wrote letters until 10 a.m: &amp; then I fooled away the time till midnight.</p>
