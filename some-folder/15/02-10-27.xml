         <p>Today, I returned with <persName id="112">my wife</persName> to Westminster, having contracted the customary "honey-moon" into the space of a single week.  We travelled from the ceremony to Bath, &amp; there spent the night.  The next day we went on to Torquay, where a most comfortable house had been lent us by <persName id="295">M<hi rend="sup u">rs</hi> Hamilton Dundas</persName>.  Here we remained until Saturday, driving about the country.  We spent Sunday in Oxford, as guests of the <persName id="228">Warden</persName>.  Here we found <persName id="76">Mother</persName> &amp; <persName id="77">Marion</persName>, who stayed to lunch, and then went off to <hi rend="u">their</hi> new home at Horley.  I saw them into the train at Victoria.</p>
         <p>I sent copies of <ref id="13">"Preaching to the Times"</ref> to the <persName id="296">Sub-dean</persName>, <persName id="297">Precentor</persName>, <persName id="298">Greatorex</persName>, <persName id="299">the Receiver</persName>, &amp; <persName id="241">Sir F. Bridge.</persName></p>
