         <p>I wrote a short sermon for the <orgName id="45">Church Lads Brigade</orgName> Service tomorrow.  <persName id="62">Kirshbaum</persName> took me for a short walk, in the course of which I told him of my project for <persName id="113">Harold</persName>.  On the whole he approved.  <persName id="189">Frank Green</persName> called &amp; had tea. He has grown greatly. By some oversight no programmes arrived for the Organ Recital, to <persName id="121">Custard</persName>'s consternation.</p>
