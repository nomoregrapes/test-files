         <p><persName id="250">Watson</persName> came to lunch, and we had much talk.  <hi rend="b u">He is sound on the V-B question, but misdoubts most of the Bishops.</hi>

<hi rend="b u"><persName id="99">Dean Bradley</persName>'s death was quickly - within 10 days - followed by <persName id="187">Dean Farrar</persName>'s</hi>. I preached in <orgName id="16">S. Margaret's</orgName> sermons in which a decent, &amp; I hope sufficient, reference was made to both.  The Dean was buried with much reverent pomp in <persName id="361">Atterbury</persName>'s vault.</p>
         <p>April: 4<hi rend="sup u">th</hi> 1903.  The Times announces the appointment of <persName id="212">D<hi rend="sup u">r</hi><hi rend="b sup"></hi> Wace</persName> to be Dean of Canterbury.</p>
         <p><persName id="208">Beeching</persName> sent to ask me to preach for him tomorrow afternoon in the Abbey: he being prostrate with a chill.  I showed a party from <orgName id="153">Westbourne Park Institute</orgName> over the Abbey: &amp; then attended the performance of <persName id="1836">Gounod</persName>'s Redemption in S. Margaret's. </p>
         <p><persName id="362">Fred: Gore</persName> was buried this afternoon.</p>
