         <p>We began with a disaster. As he was carrying the vessels to the Altar before the early Celebration, <persName id="113">Harold</persName> tripped over his <term id="12">cassock</term>, &amp; fell, breaking both the small silver-bound glass-flagons.  Then my neighbours the <persName id="674">Hudsons</persName> came in distress seeking means to destroy a strayed &amp; wounded cat, which was making demonstrations of distress in their back area! I bade the police to send on the watchman as soon as he arrived.  </p>
         <p>
<hi rend="b u">At Mattins <persName id="114">Bishop Welldon</persName> was the preacher, &amp; preached excellently</hi>.  There was a fair congregation (considering the weather), but the Offertory was but &#x00A3;10.8.0.  The wind blew a hurricane as the day advanced, &amp; between the blasts of the gale there were deluges of rain.  At Evensong I preached from a type-written MS., and afterwards conducted the devotional service, when I began some observations on the 51<hi rend="sup u">st</hi> Psalm.  <persName id="121">Custard</persName> and <persName id="675">Wright</persName> came to supper. 	</p>
