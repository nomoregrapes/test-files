         <p>I spent the morning in preparing some notes for an address on "Home Reunion".  Then I attended the Memorial Service in Holy Trinity, Sloane Square, for poor <persName id="317">Medd</persName>. <persName id="324">Amery</persName> came on afterwards to lunch. Then <persName id="62">Kirshbaum</persName> and I went to the <placeName id="11">Collegiate House</placeName>, hard by S. Thomas's Hospital, where I delivered an <event id="8">address</event> on "Home Reunion" to some 25 parsons. The "discussion" was rather disheartening, but very suggestive in a painful way.  I dined with <persName id="46">Miss Leslie</persName>, who goes to Malta tomorrow.</p>
