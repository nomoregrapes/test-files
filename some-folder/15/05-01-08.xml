<hi rend="italic">About 5 a.m. the doctor came to my study to say that the end had been reached.  <persName xml:id="112">Ella</persName> was well, and the child was born dead.  So ends another, surely the last of my dreams.  The whole house mocks me at every corner with futile preparations for babyhood.  I went to Church, &amp; Celebrated at 8 a.m. with an effort; and twice I preached, fighting the while a desperate battle against the contemptible weakness which would sit down and cry.  I looked at the dead boy; he is fashioned completely, &amp; fairly proportioned though small: his tiny face had a care-stricken and sorrowful look which sufficiently confessed its father.  It is no â€˜stillborn infant' that I mourn, but my own son.</hi>

This is the finest element of  our sensibility. She accordingly urges us to weep for the ward who summons his defrauder to court, with his girlish hair making indeterminate the sex of his face, streaming with tears. It's by Nature's command that we sigh when we meet the funeral of a marriageable virgin or <hi rend="underline">when a baby is buried in the ground, too young for the pyre's flame.</hi> The fact is that no person who is good and worthy of the mystic touch, who behaves as the priest of Ceres wishes, considers the distress of others irrelevant to themselves. This is what separates us from the herd of dumb creatures. So we are the only ones alloted a disposition worthy of respect, who can comprehend divinity, who are equipped to practise and invent the arts and crafts; we are the ones to derive a sensibility sent down from the height of heaven, something missing from the four-footed creatures that face towards the earth. To them, at the beginning of the world, our common creator granted only the breath of life. To us he gave souls as well. His interntion? So our mutual feeling would urge us to seek and offer help,]</cell>
