         <p><persName xml:id="14">Raleigh</persName> and I visited the exhibition of portraits in the Schools: and then I called on <persName xml:id="222">Albert</persName> in Queen's.  <hi rend="italic bold underline">In the afternoon, I went to the Theatre &amp; voted in the minority for the removal of the restriction of Examinerships in the Theology School to Anglican clergy</hi><hi rend="italic">. The country parsons swarmed up in overwhelming numbers, &amp; rejected the Statute by nearly 3 to 1. It was a horrid display of unabated clerical fanaticism, and depressed one considerably. The numbers were 298 to 676.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>After the voting I walked round the Park with Raleigh and <persName xml:id="251">Robertson</persName>.  I dined in college, and then travelled to town in company of <persName xml:id="213">Athelstan Riley</persName>.</p>
