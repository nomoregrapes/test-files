         <p><persName id="222">Albert</persName> wrote letters at my dictation for 2 hours: then <hi rend="i b u"><persName id="117">Rashdall</persName></hi><hi rend="i"> came to lunch, &amp; afterwards showed me the proof of his article in the <ref id="29">Independent Review</ref> replying to <persName id="359">Sanday</persName></hi>. We walked the length of the Embankment &amp; back.  Only one girl – <persName id="499">Irene Meiklejohn</persName> – came to the preparation class for Confirmation – a bad start!  Then I made prodigious efforts to clear up my room.  <hi rend="u"><persName id="363">Ian Malcolm</persName></hi> sent his motor car, &amp; we went easily to Hampstead &amp; dined.  Nobody but Ian, &amp; his <persName id="364">wife</persName> &amp; us.  He has an extraordinary collection of interesting things - Portraits of <persName id="500">Pitt</persName>, curiosities of all kinds from the East.  We returned home by the same swift &amp; agreeable means.</p>
