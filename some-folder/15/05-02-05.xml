         <p>A warm but rather languid day.  I celebrated at 8 a.m. there were 29 comm<hi rend="superscript underline">ts</hi>. Only 8 boys attended the special celebration at 9 a.m.: there were 80 comm<hi rend="superscript underline">ts</hi> at the 12.30 making a total of 117 for the day.</p>
         <p>I preached two sermons which had been preached in the Abbey as recently as Nov: 1903.  It will be curious to see if anybody recognizes them.</p>
         <p>There seemed a fair congregation, but the offertory was disappointingly small.  Amongst others I noticed <persName xml:id="491">Lady Frances Balfour</persName>, <persName xml:id="66">Frank Pember</persName>, &amp; <persName xml:id="115">Buchanan</persName> in church.</p>
         <p>At Evensong there was a large congregation, among which I noticed the <persName xml:id="667">Bishop of Dover</persName>, &amp; several clergy.</p>
         <p><persName xml:id="121">Custard</persName> came to supper. Offertory &#x00A3;6.6.6.</p>
