He is an extremely interesting man.  He was originally ordained in the English Church, then seceded to the Church of Rome, where he was re-ordained, &amp; served in the priesthood for four years.

He assured me that the degrading penitential service of "Flagellation", as described by <persName id="338">Blanco White</persName> in his <ref id="297">Autobiography</ref>, actually proceeds in England, that Newman regularly engaged in it, that he himself had done so, </hi><hi rend="i b u">that he had seen men whose backs were covered with scars from it</hi><hi rend="i">, that commonly it was less severe in England than in Spain, that it was never alluded to in conversation by R.Cs. </hi>
