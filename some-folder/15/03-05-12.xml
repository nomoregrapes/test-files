         <p>I attended the meeting of <orgName xml:id="68">Convocation</orgName>, and was nominated by the <term xml:id="5">Prolocutor</term> one of the <term xml:id="6">Assessors</term> for the day. A resolution was moved by <persName xml:id="373" display="no">M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Proctor</persName> &amp; seconded by <persName xml:id="177">Bishop Barry</persName>, asking for a ‘Joint Committee' ‘on the relation of National Churches to the Church Catholic'; and to this I moved, and <persName xml:id="68">Canon Pereira</persName> seconded, an amendment substituting for these words the following, ‘the relation of the Church of England to the other branches of Christ's Church Catholic as well episcopal and non-episcopal'. On this discussion proceeded until lunch time, with one interruption when we were summoned to the Upper House.  The <persName xml:id="374">Dean of Salisbury</persName>, Canons <persName xml:id="375">Worlledge</persName> &amp; <persName xml:id="376">Knox-Little</persName> &amp; others opposed: old <persName xml:id="377">Archdeacon Kaye</persName>, &amp; another supported.  Finally, the <persName xml:id="44">Dean of Westminster</persName> suggested a compromise.  I would withdraw my amendment &amp; bring it forward as a separate motion.  To this I agreed.  And later in the day we drafted this</p>
         <p>‘That, in view of the widely-felt desire for the union of Christians, and the mischievous consequences of existing religious divisions, the President be respectfully requested to direct the appointment of a Joint Committee to investigate &amp; report on the <hi rend="bold">[178]</hi> obligation of the Church of England to the whole body of baptized persons.'</p>
         <p>We also decided to postpone the discussion until the next group of Sessions.</p>
         <p>There lunched here:-</p>
