         <p>I travelled to Falconhurst to dine &amp; sleep.  <persName id="119">George Talbot</persName> was there, and <persName id="120">Strong</persName>.  We had much talk about <orgName id="16">S. Margaret's</orgName>.  <hi rend="b u">I proposed to M</hi><hi rend="b sup u">r</hi><hi rend="b u"> Talbot that the <orgName id="136">Burgesses of Oxford</orgName> &amp; <orgName id="137">Cambridge</orgName> should offer a copy of the Revised Version for use in the Abbey</hi>: so that my motion in Chapter would be met by their proposal from outside.  M<hi rend="sup u">r</hi> Talbot received my suggestion with great goodwill, and undertook to write forthwith to his fellow-burgesses.</p>
