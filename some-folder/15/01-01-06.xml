         <p>The first Sunday in the century coincides with the Feast of the Epiphany. I celebrated in <orgName xml:id="16">S. Margaret's</orgName> at 8 a.m.: and in the Abbey after mattins.  <hi rend="bold underline"><persName xml:id="118">Rashdall</persName> preached an excellent sermon, the first he had ever preached in the Abbey</hi>; &amp; afterwards stayed to lunch &amp; afternoon service.  <hi rend="bold underline">I preached my first sermon as Canon-in-Residence.</hi>  In spite of the bitter weather, there was a large congregation.  My text was Heb.XIII.8, and I preached for exactly 35 minutes.  The people seemed to me very attentive.  <hi rend="bold">[</hi><persName xml:id="76">Tommie</persName> and <persName xml:id="8">Alfred</persName> also came to the Abbey<hi rend="bold">]</hi>.  <hi rend="bold underline">In the Evening I went to S. Paul's, and <listEvent><event xml:id="91" display="no">preached</event></listEvent> to an immense congregation. It was my first sermon in that cathedral</hi>, and I was invited to preach, not by the <persName xml:id="1555">Dean</persName> &amp; Chapter, but by the <persName xml:id="118">Bishop</persName>. </p>
