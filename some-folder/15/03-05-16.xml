         <p>I wrote part of a sermon: and showed a party round the Abbey. <persName id="189">Frank Green</persName> came to see me, and before he left we spent half an hour in looking at the Abbey. <persName id="208">Beeching</persName> came to dinner and stayed the night.</p>
         <p>The "Daily Express", a half-penny newspaper, published <ref id="300"><ref id="301">letters</ref></ref> from <persName id="114">Welldon</persName> &amp; me, denouncing the gambling associated with bridge. The Editor had adroitly conjured these epistles out of us.</p>
