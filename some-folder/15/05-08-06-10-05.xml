At Mattins there was a considerable congregation, and no less than 95 comm<hi rend="superscript underline">ts</hi>.  I preached from the "parable" of the Feeding of the 4000 <hi rend="bold">[sic]</hi>, which happened to be the Gospel for the day.  We all had tea on the roof, a circumstance which indicates <persName xml:id="112">my wife</persName>'s progress towards recovery.  I wrote at some length to the <persName xml:id="560">Admiral</persName>.</p>
