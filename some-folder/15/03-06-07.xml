         <p>Sixteen years since I was ordained!  I went to <orgName xml:id="16">S. Margaret's</orgName> at 8 a.m. &amp; celebrated with the thought paramount in my mind - very saddening &amp; solemn.  There was a large congregation at the Choral Celebration.  I preached on Isaiah's vision.  There were over 130 com<hi rend="superscript">ts</hi>, among them <persName xml:id="253">Sir Henry Fowler</persName>, who is a Wesleyan. I saw <persName xml:id="403">Dicey</persName> also in the Church.</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="italic bold underline">In the evening I <listEvent><event xml:id="113">preached</event></listEvent> in the nave of the Abbey, using for the first time after so long an interval, the old wooden pulpit which is said to have been used by <persName xml:id="1838">Cranmer</persName> at the Coronation of <persName xml:id="1837">Edward VI</persName></hi>.  There was a big crowd, &amp; I had a portentous headache, but I think everybody was able to hear.  My sermon took just 40 minutes to deliver.</p>
         <p>Immediately on my return to the house, I went to bed.</p>

         <p>Almighty God.  Who hast wonderfully led me to this hour, &amp; didst will in Thy Mysterious Providence that I should stand before my fellow-men as Thy Messenger, have mercy upon me, &amp; forgive the failures, infidelities, &amp; offences of these years, and make possible to me the fulfilment of the charge which Thou hast laid upon me.  I beseech Thee for Thy cleansing Spirit that I may be made holy &amp; clean as becomes Thy minister.  I pray Thy Guidance in my Thoughts, Thy government in my speech, Thy direction in my acts.  â€˜Show Thou me the way that I should walk in for I lift up my soul unto Thee'.  Have compassion on Thy people, who look to me for teaching &amp; example, &amp; protect them from my errors &amp; faults.  Kindle afresh in my heart zeal for Thy service, &amp; love for Thy flock.  Grant me, if it be Thy will, a measure of happiness in the work to which Thou hast called me, &amp; preserve me from bringing dishonour on Thy name.  All these my prayers I offer in the Name of Thy Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.</p>
         <p>Amen</p>
