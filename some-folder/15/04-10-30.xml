         <p>I celebrated at 8 a.m.  There were 20 communicants.  <hi rend="i">At Mattins I preached on "the pathos of inadequacy", taking the phrase &amp;, to some extent, the thought from <persName id="625">Bishop Paget</persName>'s fine sermon on S. Edward's day last year.  There was a fair congregation.</hi>  At Evensong I preached again, an old sermon originally written at Ilford in 1897, &amp; now revised.  The whole afternoon I worked at revising it.  The congregation was large. </p>
         <p>Also I wrote to <persName id="76">Carissima</persName>.</p>
