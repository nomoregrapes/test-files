         </p>
         <p>I went into the City, &amp; preached at <orgName id="39">S. Stephen's Walbrook</orgName>, <hi rend="b u">the annual sermon of the <orgName id="38">Churchmen's Union</orgName></hi>. There was a fair congregation, presumably composed of members of the Union. After preaching, I lunched with old <persName id="396">D<hi rend="sup u">r</hi> White</persName>, the Rector of <orgName id="40">S. Mary, Aldermanbury</orgName>.  He shewed me his church built by <persName id="397">Wren</persName>, a very fine work.  Then I attended a meeting in the <placeName id="13">Church House</placeName> of the said Union.  <persName id="398">Morrison</persName> was in the Chair: <persName id="399">Lord Avebury</persName>, <persName id="400">Sir M. Grant Duff</persName>, <persName id="401">Sir Edward Russell</persName>, &amp; <persName id="402">Percy Gardner</persName> were the principal speakers.  I spoke briefly.</p>
         <p>After dinner I had 17 communicant boys together, talked to them about the <orgName id="41">Guild of Perseverance</orgName>, &amp; gave them supper.</p>
