         <p>The Holy Week has been filled with writing sermons and delivering them. On Tuesday, I preached at the Preparation Service (which was ill attended): on Good Friday, I preached at Mattins, and on Easter Day, I preached at the Choral Eucharist, and (but this was an old sermon) at Evensong.</p>
         <p>The communicants were more by 2 than last year viz: </p>

         <p>I preached on the 'Sacrament of Unity', and took the opportunity of re-affirming my plea for 'intercommunion'.</p>
