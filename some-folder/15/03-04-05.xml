         <p>I preached at Mattins on "Judas Iscariot" to but a moderate congregation.</p>

         <p>The Holy Week has been filled with writing sermons and delivering them. On Tuesday, I preached at the Preparation Service (which was ill attended): on Good Friday, I preached at Mattins, and on Easter Day, I preached at the Choral Eucharist, and (but this was an old sermon) at Evensong.</p>
         <p>The communicants were more by 2 than last year viz: </p>

         <p>I preached on the 'Sacrament of Unity', and took the opportunity of re-affirming my plea for 'intercommunion'.</p>
         <p>In the Abbey it is stated that there were at 8 a.m. 98 comm<hi rend="superscript underline">ts</hi>, and at noon 300: a total of 398: making for both churches a grand total of 780</p>
