<hi rend="b">Passion Sunday, April 9</hi><hi rend="b sup u">th</hi><hi rend="b">, 1905.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>A dull morning tending to be wet. There were but 18 comm<hi rend="sup u">ts</hi> including 4 clergy.  Rain set in about 9 a.m. and fell all day.  By consequence the congregation at Mattins was small.  I noticed in the Parl<hi rend="sup u">y</hi> Seats:- <persName id="672">Lord Rayleigh</persName>, <persName id="193">Sir Michael Hicks Beach</persName>, <persName id="604">Sir John Gorst</persName>, <persName id="679">M<hi rend="sup u">r</hi> Ainsworth</persName>, <persName id="419">M<hi rend="sup u">r</hi> Craig</persName>, <persName id="230">Sir Ch<hi rend="sup u">s</hi> Renshaw</persName>, &amp; several other M.P.s.  <persName id="680">D<hi rend="sup u">r</hi> Malcolm</persName> was also there, &amp; he came into lunch with his <persName id="681">sister</persName>.</p>
         <p>In the afternoon, <persName id="113">Harold</persName> and I set off to Bethnal Green, where I gave an <event id="133">address</event> in the Swimming Bath (adapted in the winter as an assembly Hall) to about 150 men on "Personal Religion".</p>
         <p>At Evensong, there was a small congregation, to which I preached on Fasting or Discipline. After service I gave a concluding address on the 51<hi rend="sup u">st</hi> Psalm; and then baptized <persName id="678">Miss Edith Rignall</persName>, one of my candidates for confirmation.</p>
