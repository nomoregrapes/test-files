<hi rend="b">Sunday after Ascension Day, May 15</hi><hi rend="b sup u">th</hi><hi rend="b">, 1904.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>A glorious early summer day.  At 8 a.m. I celebrated: there were 32 cts viz: 3 clergy 1 verger 4 men, 24 women &amp; girls - it is not a pleasing proportion.</p>
         <p>At Mattins there was but a moderate congregation. I preached on S. John IV. 35-38, which came in the 2<hi rend="sup u">nd</hi> lesson.</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="du"><persName id="488">Turnbull</persName></hi> came in to see me after service: he thanked me warmly for the <ref id="15">Hibbert Article</ref> which he said was very helpful to him, &amp; many whom he represented - perplexed men, who had begun to despair of the Faith.</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="du"><persName id="558">Lady Wingate</persName></hi>, the <persName id="559">Sirdar</persName>'s wife, came to lunch. She seems to have gone about with her husband in his expeditions. On one occasion she saw 30 hippos together. She says that visitors are numerous at Khartoum, the hotel accommodating 30 being generally full.</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="du"><persName id="556">George Dennistoun</persName></hi> &amp; I walked to Chelsea, &amp; through Battersea Park.  The river &amp; trees were splendid.  On the whole, expenditure on public parks is worth while.</p>
         <p>At Evensong I preached to a congregation which bore quite evident traces of the extraordinary fineness of the weather.  </p>
