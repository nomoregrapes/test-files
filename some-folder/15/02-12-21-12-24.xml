         <p>I preached twice in the Abbey, at Mattins and in the afternoon.  In the morning I used an old sermon on the Eucharist, preached as recently as Palm Sunday in <orgName id="16">S. Margaret's</orgName>. In the afternoon, I preached on "The Faith that is blessed", the subject naturally suggested by S. Thomas's Day. There was a large congregation, more mingled with restless elements than usual, as, I observe, is the case when holiday seasons approach. My sermon took just 35 minutes to deliver.</p>
         <p>At Evensong I preached in S. Margaret's on the Holy Communion, and afterwards conducted a Preparation Service, which was well attended.  </p>

         <p>On Christmas Eve, I received another letter from <persName id="331">M<hi rend="sup u">r</hi> Routledge</persName>, to which I replied.</p><div type="letter">

         <p>My dear Sir,</p>
         <p>I am very sure that anyone who cared for your character &amp; reputation, as - though you may not believe it - I do, would approve the course which I have adopted, and, assuredly, nothing will induce me to adopt any other course.  Consult your friends.  You are a Harrovian.  Take counsel with your old Head-master, <persName id="114">Bishop Welldon</persName>, who is again in England, &amp; follow their advice, if you will not follow mine.  I have nothing more to say to you.</p>
         <p>Believe me,</p>
         <p>faithfully yrs,</p>
         <p>H. Hensley Henson</p></div>
