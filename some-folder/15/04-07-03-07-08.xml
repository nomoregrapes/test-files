         <p>A dark &amp; thunderous day which began with a deluge.  I celebrated in much physical discomfort, being nearly voiceless &amp; my head aching badly, at 8 a.m.  There were 27 comm<hi rend="sup u">ts</hi>.  I preached with husky fervour to a congregation by no means large.  <hi rend="b u"><persName id="268">Principal Rainy</persName> was sitting under my pulpit</hi>. During the Celebration (at which were 90 comm<hi rend="sup u">ts</hi>) there was a tremendous downpour.</p>
         <p>At Evensong I preached again with a voice like a raven.</p>

<hi rend="b u">On Tuesday &amp; Wednesday the <orgName id="68">Convocation</orgName> of Canterbury</hi> held sessions, &amp; I wasted in attending them those days.  Beyond a short speech in favour of vesting <persName id="589">Glebes</persName> in the <orgName id="156">Eccl<hi rend="sup u">l</hi> Comm<hi rend="sup u">n</hi></orgName>, I took no part in the proceedings.  On Thursday &amp; Friday were the meetings of what called itself the <orgName id="57">"Representative Church Council"</orgName>.  Here also I showed up &amp; wasted two days, but took no part in the business.</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="i">The members, so far as I could judge, regarded me with kindness.</hi>  <hi rend="i">There was no Disinclination to receive my hospitality, (21 members lunched here) and no reluctance to acknowledge acquaintance.</hi>  <hi rend="i bold doubleunderline"><persName id="590">Archdeacon Watkins</persName></hi><hi rend="i b u"> of Durham volunteered to thank me for my book</hi><hi rend="i">: &amp; several members were very complimentary on my speech.</hi>  <hi rend="i">Moreover the fanaticks were either absent, or silent, and wore a sulky &amp; baffled aspect, as men who dimly saw that they were disapproved.</hi>

<hi rend="i">Friday's Literary Supplement of the 'Times' had more than a column on <ref id="40">"Canon Henson's Answer"</ref>: &amp; there were 3 columns of hostile <ref id="41">"review"</ref> in the "Church Times" of the same date.</hi>
