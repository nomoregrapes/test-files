         <p>I was occupied all the morning in writing a sermon for Sunday morning. After lunch I called on <persName id="216">Gow</persName>, &amp; talked awhile with him.  Then I took a constitutional on the Embankment returning thro' the City. In the window of a bookstall in Whitehall I saw <persName id="117">Rashdall</persName>'s â€˜<ref id="44">Doctrine &amp; Development</ref>' marked 1/3 &amp; I bought it at once.  Side by side with it was my own "<ref id="5">Apostolic X<hi rend="sup u">ty</hi></ref>" offered for the same <hi rend="u">humbling</hi> figure.</p>
         <p>Reading:-</p>
         <p>Rashdall's Doctrine &amp; Development.  pp 1-109.</p>
