         <p>A glorious bright day and very hot. There were 40 communicants at 8 a.m., when I celebrated. At Mattins the attenuated congregation certified that the end of â€˜the season' draws on apace. I preached wearily on "<hi rend="underline">Rabbinism &amp; Fraternity</hi>". S. Matt xxiii.8. In the afternoon I went to the Abbey, and heard an extremely elegant sermon from the <persName xml:id="280">Bishop of Ripon</persName> on Isaiah 44.16-17.  At Evensong there was a moderate congregation, which included the old <persName xml:id="585">Baroness Burdett Coutts</persName>, and the <orgName xml:id="45">Church Lads Brigade</orgName>.</p>
         <p>After Supper I had a long talk with <persName xml:id="586">Wood</persName>, an odd youth who has 'doubts'.</p>
