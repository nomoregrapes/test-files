         <p>This was the first Sunday in Session. I preached in continuation of last Sunday's sermon on 'Christianity as a law of conduct'. There was a large congregation: &amp; the offertory amounted to &#x00A3;16.10.0. <persName id="66">Frank Pember</persName> came to lunch, and afterwards walked with me.</p>
         <p>At Evensong there was a fair congregation: the boisterous wind may well have deterred some people from venturing out.</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="i"><persName id="329">Lyster Jandron</persName> came to supper. He is a strange lad, not yet eighteen, yet already (so he tells me) writing articles for the Westminster Gazette.</hi>
