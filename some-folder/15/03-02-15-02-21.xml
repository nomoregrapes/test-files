         <p>I celebrated at 8 a.m. There were 31 comm<hi rend="sup u">ts</hi>.  At Mattins I preached to a fair congregation.  <persName id="227">Murray</persName> &amp; <persName id="666">his wife</persName> came to lunch: also <persName id="349">Bruce</persName> &amp; <hi rend="u">his</hi>. After lunch I went off to the <orgName id="15">Oxford House</orgName> with <persName id="293">Edwin</persName> &amp; <persName id="113">Harold</persName>.  Murray came with us. The <event id="9">concluding lecture</event>, "The Challenge of Life", was well attended: &amp; the men gave me very close attention. <persName id="282">Campbell</persName> preached at Evensong.</p>

<hi rend="i doubleunderline">On Wednesday the 18</hi><hi rend="i superscript doubleunderline">th</hi><hi rend="i doubleunderline"> of Feb: 1903, I first sat in <orgName id="68">Convocation</orgName></hi><hi rend="i">.  The <persName id="44">Dean</persName> introduced me.  </hi><hi rend="i b u">The proceeding seemed to me in the extremest degree tiresome &amp; futile</hi><hi rend="i">.  On Thursday, the <persName id="128">new Primate</persName> came in to us, &amp; made a pleasant conventional speech.  On Friday, <persName id="350">Canon Thompson</persName> moved a resolution, of which the gist was a protest against the Kenyon-Slaney Clause.<note id="19" n="1"></note>  </hi><hi rend="i b u">I replied in a maiden speech, which was very well received</hi><hi rend="i">. The previous question was carried by 37 to 24.  I notice that the York Convocation has been discussing the Virgin-Birth of Christ: &amp; that, in the course of the discussion, <persName id="351">Canon Lister</persName> denounced <ref id="12">"Cross-bench Views"</ref>, &amp; accused me by name of 'treason".</hi>  <hi rend="i b u">I copied out the incriminating paragraphs and sent them to the 'Times'.</hi>

         <p>On Saturday morning at 8 a.m. <persName id="352">Bertram Talbot</persName> was married in <orgName id="16">S. Margaret's</orgName> to <persName id="353">Lady Lothian</persName>.  He is 38 and she 59!  Old <persName id="354">M<hi rend="sup u">r</hi> Hunt</persName> of Markbeech performed the service: &amp; immediately thereafter I celebrated the Eucharist.</p>
