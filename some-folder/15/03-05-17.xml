         <p>I celebrated at 8 a.m. There were 45 comm<hi rend="superscript underline">ts</hi>, nearly all women. There was an immense congregation at 11 a.m., when the <persName xml:id="166">Bp. of London</persName> preached on behalf of his <orgName xml:id="132" display="no">Fund</orgName>. The Offertory = &#x00A3;115.19.5.  <hi rend="italic">The Bishop lunched here afterwards.  After lunch I had a little conversation with him privately as to the proceedings in <orgName xml:id="68">Convocation</orgName>.  <persName xml:id="376">Knox Little</persName> had been giving his own account: &amp; the Bishop seemed surprised to learn that </hi><hi rend="italic underline">he</hi><hi rend="italic"> &amp; not </hi><hi rend="italic underline">I</hi><hi rend="italic"> was responsible for bringing the subject of the Virgin-Birth before the Convocation. I made the Bishop read my record of the proceedings.  He told </hi><hi rend="i subscript">^ </hi><hi rend="italic">me </hi><hi rend="i subscript">^ </hi><hi rend="italic">that he was himself opposed to a declaration, that </hi><hi rend="italic bold underline"><persName xml:id="49">Gore</persName> was pressing for one, that the <persName xml:id="128">Abp.</persName> was opposed</hi><hi rend="italic">, that the whole subject was to be discussed again in July.</hi>

         <p>
<hi rend="italic bold underline"><persName xml:id="346">Alan Henderson</persName> took me for a walk up the Embankment &amp; back</hi><hi rend="italic">.  It rained &amp; thundered intermittently all the afternoon.  At Evensong, I preached to a congregation visibly thinned by the weather.  </hi>
