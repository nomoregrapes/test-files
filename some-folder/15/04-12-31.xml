<hi rend="b">New Year's Eve, December 31</hi><hi rend="b sup u">st</hi><hi rend="b">, 1904. </hi>
         </p>
         <p>I went across to <orgName id="16">S. Margaret's</orgName> &amp; married one <persName id="629">Richardson</persName>, a friend of <persName id="22">Ker</persName>'s <persName id="628">brother</persName>.  Then, but painfully, I finished a sermon. </p>
         <p>After prayers I went to my room and wrote letters, <hi rend="i">among them one to <persName id="14">Raleigh</persName>, in which I told him of </hi><hi rend="i b u">the expected arrival of an infant, &amp; invoked his service as a sponsor!</hi>
         </p>
         <p>The year has been contentious and exhausting, and I emerge at the finish wonderfully discredited and disheartened.  May God pardon my blunders and failures: &amp; grant a measure of peace &amp; comfort to me in the new year! </p>
