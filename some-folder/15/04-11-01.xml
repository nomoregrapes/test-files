         <p><persName id="62">Kirshbaum</persName> celebrated.  There were 15 communicants.  <hi rend="b u">I made a vain attempt to see <persName id="648">Caröe</persName>, the architect, who has designed that hapless <persName id="187">Farrar</persName> monument</hi>.  Then I saw the <persName id="44">Dean</persName> with reference to the dinner.  Thus my morning was frittered away, <hi rend="i">but I succeeded in reading through <persName id="1845">Bevan</persName>'s interesting sketch, <ref id="58">‘Jerusalem under the High Priests'</ref>.</hi>

         <p>In the afternoon I travelled to Oxford in order to attend the Gaudy.<note id="34" n="1"></note>  In the train I read through most part of <persName id="325">Bp. Ryle's</persName> little book on <ref id="59">"Criticism &amp; the Old Testament"</ref>.  It is timely &amp; honest.  <hi rend="i b u">In Hall I sat next <persName id="130">Lang</persName>, and was churlish to him</hi>.</p>
