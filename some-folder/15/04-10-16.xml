         <p><persName id="489">Sherwood</persName> celebrated in <orgName id="16">S. Margaret's</orgName> for the first time, and I served. He is a good fellow, may God guide his course! At Mattins there was a larger congregation than I had ventured to expect. I preached from the Epistle for the day, Eph.V.17, and afterwards celebrated the Holy Communion.</p>
         <p><persName id="630">Bincham</persName> and <persName id="631">Pegden</persName> came to lunch: my godson, <persName id="554">Gilbert Simpson</persName>, came to tea: and <persName id="467">Chart</persName> and <persName id="632">Reggie</persName> - the little fellow I picked up in the Abbey last week - came to supper.  At Evensong there was a fair congregation: I preached from the second lesson on "the Urgency of human life".</p>
