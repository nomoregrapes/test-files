         <p>A very hot day. I celebrated at 8 a.m.  48 comm<hi rend="sup u">ts</hi>. I preached at 11 a.m. There was a very full church, but a restless congregation on account of the heat.  <hi rend="i">After service </hi><hi rend="i b u">a huge American invaded the Vestry. He was the <persName id="710">Bishop of Rhode Island</persName>.</hi>  <hi rend="i">There were 82 comm</hi><hi rend="i sup u">ts</hi><hi rend="i"> at the 2</hi><hi rend="i sup u">nd</hi><hi rend="i"> celebration.  </hi><persName id="711">Miss Montague</persName> came to lunch.</p>
         <p>At Evensong there was but a moderate congregation.  I preached rather wearily: after service the Vestry was <hi rend="i">invaded by </hi><hi rend="i b u">a Presbyterian clergyman named <persName id="712">Muir</persName></hi><hi rend="i">, who said he was attached to Glasgow Cathedral, and would rejoice if I would preach there</hi>. Of course I said that I would if it could be arranged. <persName id="222">Albert Saxton</persName> came to supper; &amp; I gave him my photograph as he goes off tomorrow.                                  </p>
