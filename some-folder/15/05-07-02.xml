         <p>A very hot day. I celebrated at 8 a.m.  48 comm<hi rend="superscript underline">ts</hi>. I preached at 11 a.m. There was a very full church, but a restless congregation on account of the heat.  <hi rend="italic">After service </hi><hi rend="italic bold underline">a huge American invaded the Vestry.

         <p>At Evensong there was but a moderate congregation.
