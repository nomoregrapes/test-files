         <p>I celebrated at 8 a.m. when there were 29 comm<hi rend="sup u">ts</hi>.  After an absence of 8 weeks, the service seemed like a fresh start.  Ah, if only fresh starts were anyway possible!  There was a very large congregation at Mattins, but a disappointing offertory.  In the course of my sermon I made a brief reference to <persName id="98">M<hi rend="sup u">r</hi> Hunt</persName> &amp; to <persName id="613">Sir W<hi rend="sup u">m</hi> Harcourt</persName>.  <persName id="556"><hi rend="u">George Dennistoun</hi></persName> came to lunch, &amp; to say Goodbye before leaving for Portsmouth this afternoon.</p>
         <p>The church was again crowded at Evensong: I preached rather helplessly from the Parable of the Sower.  At the close of the service the â€˜Te Deum' was sung.</p>
