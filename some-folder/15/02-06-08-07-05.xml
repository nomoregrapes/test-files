<hi rend="i">The Thanksgiving for Peace attracted great congregations both at Mattins &amp; at Evensong.<note id="17" n="1"></note>  I preached at both services.  The Commons were represented by <persName id="253">Sir Henry Fowler</persName> &amp; <persName id="255">Sir Walter Foster</persName>, everybody else had gone to S. Paul's to be with the <persName id="928">King</persName>.  </hi>
         </p>
         <p>
<hi rend="i b u">In the congregation was the <persName id="257">Abp. of Armagh</persName>, who afterwards observed to Miss L. of my sermon, that it was "Liddon at his best", which seems extravagant even for an Irishman</hi><hi rend="i bold">.</hi><hi rend="i">  <persName id="216">Gow</persName> read the first Lesson: &amp; the <persName id="99">Dean</persName> the second.</hi>

<hi rend="i b u">In the Evening, the <persName id="259">Bishop of New York</persName> was in the congregation</hi><hi rend="i">.  He sent me a message to the effect that 'if I would come to New York &amp; preach that sermon, I sh</hi><hi rend="i superscript underline">d</hi><hi rend="i"> have a right royal welcome'.</hi>

         <p>On Friday, the 13<hi rend="sup u">th</hi> June, I dined with <persName id="260">Lady Sherbrooke</persName>.  The weather was appalling, &amp; I was extremely indisposed: so I was not particularly happy.</p>
         <p>On Saturday, the 14<hi rend="sup u">th</hi> June, I dined with <persName id="253">Sir Henry Fowler</persName>. I took his brilliant <persName id="265">daughter</persName> down to dinner &amp; exchanged much talk with her. Among others I met <persName id="264">Sir W<hi rend="sup u">m</hi> Broadbent</persName> &amp; <persName id="266">M<hi rend="sup u">r</hi> Robson</persName>.  Also <persName id="255">Sir W.

         <p>O Saviour Christ, I pray Thee to own my ministry this night when in Thy Name, I pray Thy people to help Thy poor.  Save me from the condemnation of those, Who worked unrighteousness even in their preaching of Thy Gospel.  Grant that I may not hear Thee say 'Depart', in the day of judgment. Have mercy upon me, most merciful Redeemer, and forgive all my hypocrisy &amp; self-confidence &amp; lack of love. Give me Thy Spirit of tenderness and sacrifice, that the words which I speak to others may be fruitful in them and in me. Be Thou Thyself, O dear Master, the Preacher this night, and make Thy message known to Thy people. Let none go forth from Thy House untouched by Thy Word, unhelpful to Thy Cause, but bring us all nearer to Thee by our worship this day. Grant this, O saviour, for Thy tender mercy's sake.</p>
         <p>Amen.</p>

         <p>The crowds hang about Westminster from morning till evening, and gaze with unflagging delight on the decorations in the streets, the huge erections for spectators, and, above all, on the entrance hall at the Western entrance of the Abbey.  <orgName id="16">S. Margaret's</orgName>, whenever the doors are open, is invaded by visitors.  <hi rend="b u">On June 22</hi><hi rend="b sup u">nd</hi><hi rend="b u">, I preached 3 times on the Coronation.  No other subject was possible</hi>.</p>

         <p>My dear Sir,</p>
         <p>I have not seen the <ref id="14">statement in the "Daily News"</ref> to which you refer in your letter of the 4<hi rend="sup u">th</hi> July, but I gather from what you say that it was of a detailed &amp; alarmist character.  I am quite ignorant of the sources of information, from which the author of that statement drew the alleged facts.  There is, so far as I know, nothing to justify any anxiety as to the stability of the East End of S. Margaret's, or as to the preservation of the fabric of the church, or as to the fate of the great window at the East End.  If, on investigation anything seems to be required for the security of the church, no doubt the requisite steps will be taken by its responsible guardians.</p>
         <p>Believe me, </p>
