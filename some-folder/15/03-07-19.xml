         <p>The atmosphere heavy &amp; thunderous, and my spirits accordingly sunk to the deeps.  At the early Celebration it became so dark that all the light was needed. There were but 31 comm<hi rend="sup u">ts</hi>, of whom but 6 were males including the clergy.  At Mattins there was a moderate congregation: I preached on "Divine guidance": the offertory for the <orgName id="26">National Schools</orgName> was a little more than &#x00A3;14.  <persName id="462">Harry Smith</persName> came to lunch, &amp; afterwards walked with me.  He gives a sad account of religion in his class both at home &amp; abroad.  The worthlessness of the religiously observant is the stumbling-block everywhere.</p>
         <p>I preached again at Evensong to a fairly large congregation. It was an old sermon, written in Barking in 1892. During the service the organ broke down, &amp; we had to sing the hymns unaccompanied.</p>
