<hi rend="i">I dined at the <orgName id="34">Middle Temple</orgName> at the invitation of the Attorney General (<persName id="339">Sir R. Finlay</persName>). It was a most interesting dinner. </hi><persName id="340"><hi rend="i">M</hi><hi rend="i superscript underline">r</hi><hi rend="i"> Badcock</hi></persName><hi rend="i">, a stout &amp; jovial barrister, took me in, &amp; I sat opposite </hi><persName id="341"><hi rend="i">M</hi><hi rend="i superscript underline">r</hi> <hi rend="i">John Morley</hi></persName><hi rend="i">, with whom I had some interesting conversation. In the "Common Room", I had much talk with the <persName id="342">Treasurer of Lincoln's Inn</persName>: and </hi><hi rend="i b u">afterwards Finlay introduced me to <persName id="218">Lord Roberts</persName>, with whom I had a very interesting talk. He told me that he had attended all the sermons on Reunion, which I <event id="7">preached</event> in the Abbey a year ago</hi><hi rend="i">. I promised to send him a volume of <ref id="8">'Godly Union &amp; Concord'</ref>. Among the guests were the <persName id="192">Speaker</persName>, the <persName id="228">Warden</persName>, <persName id="343">Austen Chamberlain</persName>, &amp; <persName id="344">Sir Henry Craik</persName>.  Among other unusual practices, the guests wrote their names in a book after dinner.  I was told that the Hall was the loftiest in England.  It is assuredly a grand &amp; lofty chamber, but I doubt if it be loftier than the Hall of Ch: Ch.</hi>
