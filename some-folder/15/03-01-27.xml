<hi rend="italic">I dined at the <orgName xml:id="34">Middle Temple</orgName> at the invitation of the Attorney General (<persName xml:id="339">Sir R. Finlay</persName>).

Among other unusual practices, the guests wrote their names in a book after dinner.  I was told that the Hall was the loftiest in England.
