         <p>The <persName id="99">Dean</persName> being absent I celebrated at the 10 a.m. service, as well as preached. There was but a poor congregation which included the <persName id="128">Bishop of Winchester</persName>. Afterwards I went to the vestry of <orgName id="16">S. Margaret's</orgName>, and held a meeting of the Choir, the Churchwardens being also present. I laid down this rule for the boys:-</p>
         <p>That no choir-boy must accept invitations, or receive presents from strangers without a written permission from his father countersigned by the Rector.</p>
         <p>In the afternoon at the Abbey, there was a large, but not, I thought, very large congregation. I preached for 35 minutes, not very comfortably as my voice was weak. The <persName id="325">Bishop of Exeter</persName> &amp; <persName id="326">M<hi rend="sup u">rs</hi> Ryle</persName> were present, and afterwards came to tea.  At Evensong, I preached in S. Margaret's, and afterwards gave a short address on the Bible. <persName id="28">Dick Rosser</persName> came in to supper.</p>
