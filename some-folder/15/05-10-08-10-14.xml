         <p>I returned to <orgName id="16">S. Margaret's</orgName> after an unprecedented absence of no less than 8 weeks; it was a dull day minatory of rain.  I celebrated at 8 a.m. There were 17 communicants.</p>
         <p>There were considerable congregations both at Mattins, and at Evensong.  I preached on "Faction &amp; vainglory" in the morning; and on the "Healing of the Gadarene demoniac" in the evening. The last was a frankly heretical sermon</p>
         <p><persName id="250">Watson</persName> came in to supper.</p>

<hi rend="b u">On Wednesday, the 11</hi><hi rend="b sup u">th</hi><hi rend="b u"> Oct: 1905, I travelled to Portsea, and <event id="141">preached</event> in the Parish Church, where the celebration of the Dedication Festival was beginning.</hi>  There was a large congregation &amp; an immense choir of men &amp; boys.  I put up for the night at the Vicarage or Clergy-house; &amp; was much pleased with the general aspect of enthusiasm &amp; effort, which marked the place.  <hi rend="b u"><persName id="169">Bernard Wilson</persName> is certainly an excellent fellow</hi>, &amp; under his leading the parochial system shews up well.  I returned to town on Thursday morning <hi rend="b u">in time to officiate at S. Margaret's at the wedding of <persName id="750">Miss Gorst</persName> and <persName id="751">Major Herbert</persName>.</hi>  My <persName id="112">wife</persName> &amp; I attended the reception afterwards, &amp; there I met <persName id="752">Canon</persName> &amp; <persName id="753">M<hi rend="sup u">rs</hi> Barnett</persName>, whom I had not seen for nearly 20 years.  On Thursday evening I wrote a letter to the Westminster Gazette; it appeared in that paper under the heading, <ref id="71">â€˜The Clergyman in Politics'</ref>, on Saturday the 14<hi rend="sup u">th</hi>.<note id="60" n="1"></note>  The death of <persName id="754">Sir Henry Irving</persName> is announced.  A reporter attempted to obtain from me an opinion on the subject of his burial in the Abbey!
