         <p>I returned to <orgName xml:id="16">S. Margaret's</orgName> after an unprecedented absence of no less than 8 weeks; it was a dull day minatory of rain.  I celebrated at 8 a.m. There were 17 communicants.</p>
         <p>There were considerable congregations both at Mattins, and at Evensong.  I preached on "Faction &amp; vainglory" in the morning; and on the "Healing of the Gadarene demoniac" in the evening. The last was a frankly heretical sermon</p>

I put up for the night at the Vicarage or Clergy-house; &amp; was much pleased with the general aspect of enthusiasm &amp; effort, which marked the place.  <hi rend="bold underline"><persName xml:id="169">Bernard Wilson</persName> is certainly an excellent fellow</hi>, &amp; under his leading the parochial system shews up well.
