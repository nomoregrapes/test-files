<hi rend="b u"><persName id="62">Kirshbaum</persName> was married to <persName id="450">Miss Nichol</persName> in <orgName id="16">S. Margaret's</orgName> at 9 a.m. this morning</hi>.  A goodly company of her relatives &amp; his friends attended the function, &amp; <persName id="623">her brother</persName> tied the knot.  I celebrated the Holy Communion for the newly married.  Altogether a decent &amp; Christian performance.  The weather which had been still &amp; hazy, now degenerated into a London fog.  <persName id="77">Marion</persName> &amp; I attended service in the Abbey, &amp; then she returned to Horley.</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="b u"><persName id="622">Alfred Green</persName> came to see me. He is 25 years old tomorrow</hi>.  I gave him a copy of my <ref id="46"><hi rend="u">incriminated</hi> sermons</ref> as a birthday present.  At 8 p.m. I conducted the preparation service for the <orgName id="41">Guild</orgName>: &amp; at 9 p.m. I went to the Baths &amp; distributed the prizes to the Swimming Club.</p>
