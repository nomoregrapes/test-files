         <p><event id="120">Lecture II</event> was attended by rather more people, I think; but no member of the Chapter was present besides myself, and only <persName id="122">Hine-Haycock</persName> of the Minor Canons.  If anybody chose to draw certain rather obvious inferences I don't see that anyone could object.</p>
