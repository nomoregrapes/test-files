         <p>I presided at a Drawing Room Meeting in <placeName id="11">Grosvenor House</placeName> in behalf of <persName id="198">Sister Katherine</persName>'s <orgName id="29">Work</orgName> in Plaistow.  About 50 people, and most desolate performance.</p>
         <p>Then I attended the meeting of the <orgName id="146">Trustees of the Westminster Charities</orgName>, where was much business.  We appointed <persName id="156">Fedarb</persName> to be Clerk at the stipend of &#x00A3;40.</p>
         <p>Then, after dinner, I conducted the Preparation Service for the <orgName id="147">S. Paul's Guild</orgName>.  Only 21 members turned up, but they were solemn &amp; seemed sincere.</p>
