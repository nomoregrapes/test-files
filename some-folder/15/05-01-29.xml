         <p>I did not get up for the early Celebration: and at Mattins preached rather wearily to an unusually small congregation. <persName id="113">Harold</persName> took me for a walk in the afternoon: at Evensong, I preached again to what looked like a fair congregation. The Offertory, however, was but small (&#x00A3;4.16.1).  <persName id="489">Sherwood</persName> &amp; <persName id="646">his brother</persName>, &amp; <persName id="282">Campbell</persName>, came to supper.  Harold stayed the night.</p>
