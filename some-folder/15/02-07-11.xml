         <p>I celebrated the Holy Communion at 8 a.m.  After breakfast I finished my sermon for Sunday morning, and then went out &amp; got shaved.  On my return I wrote a <ref id="274">letter</ref> to the "Times" with reference to the speeches of <persName id="1337">Lord Nelson</persName> &amp; the <persName id="1048">Bp. of Truro</persName> at the annual meeting of the <orgName id="121">Home Reunion Society</orgName>.  In the course of my writing I was interrupted by a messenger from the Foreign Office, deputed to make arrangements about <persName id="273">Lord Pauncefote</persName>'s Memorial Service. <persName id="258">M<hi rend="sup u">r</hi> Parker</persName> and his nieces came to tea in the <placeName id="46">Chapter Garden</placeName>.</p>
