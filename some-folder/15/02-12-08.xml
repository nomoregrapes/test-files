He was evidently anxious to impress me with his &amp; his <persName id="328">wife</persName>'s anxiety for their son's welfare. He expressed great obligation to me for terminating a relationship which he disliked, &amp; said that he thought <persName id="113">Harold</persName> was not displeased.<note id="23" n="1"></note> I hope we have heard the last of this episode.</p>
