         <p>Another fine hazy morning promising tropical heat.  I celebrated at 8 a.m.  There were 49 cts: the service very comforting and solemn.  After breakfast I wrote a letter to Sherwood with reference to the young man's case on which he consulted me yesterday.  At Mattins there was a fair congregation including <persName xml:id="66">Frank Pember</persName>, the <persName xml:id="193">Chancellor of the Exchequer</persName>, <persName xml:id="253">Sir Henry Fowler</persName>, &amp; several M.Ps.  <hi rend="bold underline">I preached on "Friendship"</hi>. <persName xml:id="216">Gow</persName> celebrated, &amp; there were about 80 comm<hi rend="superscript underline">ts</hi>.  <hi rend="italic bold underline">Old <persName xml:id="258">Mr Parker</persName> brought his <persName xml:id="112">niece</persName> to church.

The closeness of the atmosphere combined with the great heat made Evensong very trying.  I preached an old sermon to a large congregation.  <persName xml:id="261" display="no">Fred</persName> &amp; <persName xml:id="262" display="no">Charles Ramsey</persName> &amp; <persName xml:id="263" display="no">Stanley Syms</persName> came in to supper.  At 11 p.m. I went to bed, but sleep was an impossibility.</p>
