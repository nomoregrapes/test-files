         </p>
         <p>After Mattins I revised &amp; finished the Article on the <ref xml:id="15">Resurrection</ref> which I forthwith sent to the <persName xml:id="320">Editor</persName> of the Hibbert Journal.</p>
         <p>Also I sent the 4<hi rend="superscript">th</hi> ‘Paper' on <ref xml:id="34">‘Reason &amp;c'</ref> to the Editor of Good Words.</p>
         <p>The first of my Lenten Lectures was wretchedly attended. The <persName xml:id="109">Archdeacon</persName> was holding a reception at his house. Some petty ‘Royalty' was on show, &amp; <placeName xml:id="5">Dean's Yard</placeName> was black with carriages of worshippers at that ‘shrine'!  <persName xml:id="542">M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Gow</persName> convened a meeting of some charitable sort or other at her house: &amp; <persName xml:id="543">M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi> Murray Smith</persName> gave an illustrated lecture on the Abbey close by!  Thus my congregation was reduced to the smallest proportions.  Indeed I do not remember so meagre an attendance.  There were about 200 papers <hi rend="underline">taken away</hi> by the congregation: so it may perhaps be inferred that the number of my hearers was about as many.  Afterwards I walked down the Embankment, &amp;, meeting <persName xml:id="22">Ker</persName>, as I neared my house, stood talking rashly, &amp; I contracted a chill.</p>
