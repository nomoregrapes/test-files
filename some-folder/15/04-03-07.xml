         <p>I met <persName id="520">Oxford</persName> at Paddington, and we travelled together to Cardiff.  On our arrival <hi rend="b u">we drove at once to <persName id="522">Drane</persName>'s Shop. The old man received us benevolently and</hi> started talking at a tremendous rate with the notion, I fancy, of impressing me.  He has collected a wonderful assortment of curious, and valuable articles.  His Worcester china is superb, and his silver amazing.  He has a fairly complete set of English spoons from 1325 - 1800.  He is working out the history of the fork.  He has a splendid pair of pistols that belonged to Louis XVI, and no less than 7 curious Pomanders.  He is also interested in a sardonic way in the evolution of Mariolatry, and has an astonishing array of Madonnas, pagan &amp; Christian.  Add to all this that he is a naturalist, and has succeeded in taming hares.  <hi rend="b u">He gave us a most excellent lunch, and his wines (White Burgundy &amp; Champagne) might disturb the imagination of a Lucullus</hi>.</p>
