         <p><persName id="169">Bernard Wilson</persName> preached to a large congregation at Mattins.  He made a brief allusion to the <persName id="1228">Queen</persName>: and also to the <persName id="118">Bishop</persName>.  I celebrated and, before the Prayer for the Church Militant, I asked prayer for the Queen.  <hi rend="i">It was solemn to think that probably for the last time, I was naming Victoria at the Altar where she had received her crown.  </hi>In the afternoon, there <hi rend="b">[8]</hi> was an immense throng.  <hi rend="b u">I preached for 40 minutes mainly about Bishop Creighton</hi>. The congregation was very attentive, though great part of it had to stand all the sermon through. At Evensong there was again a very large congregation. <persName id="1351">Jones</persName>, Vicar of Petworth preached.</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="b u">On Tuesday afternoon about 6.30 the Queen died</hi>.  In the afternoon at the Abbey I asked the Minor Canon, <persName id="122">Hine-Haycock</persName>, to read the prayer in the 'Communion for the Sick' inserting the Queen's name;  Earlier in the day, I had wired to the Bell-ringers postponing the supper which had been arranged for the night.  Then I went round to the Tower with <persName id="170">Perkins</persName>, and spoke to those Bell-ringers who were ringing a muffled peal, &amp; expressed my regret at being compelled to postpone the supper.</p>
