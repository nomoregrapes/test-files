<hi rend="b u"><persName id="112">My wife's</persName> birthday. I gave her <persName id="365">Lytton</persName>'s novels in 28 vols.</hi>

         <p>I celebrated at 8 a.m.: there were 40 communicants.</p>
         <p>Yesterday afternoon during Evensong in the Abbey there was a great thunderstorm, the darkness was almost as the midnight &amp; rain fell in torrents.  In spite of the weather 35 persons came to be shown over the Abbey: &amp; I acted as guide, admiring their zeal.</p>
         <p>There was a large congregation at Mattins, including <persName id="366">Lord <hi rend="u">Peel</hi></persName>, <hi rend="u"><persName id="115">Buchanan</persName></hi>, <hi rend="u"><persName id="368">Victor Cavendish</persName></hi>, <hi rend="u"><persName id="230">Renshaw</persName>[,] <persName id="255">Foster</persName></hi>, &amp; <hi rend="u"><persName id="232">Talbot</persName></hi>.  Offertory = &#x00A3;21.16.6.</p>
         <p><persName id="114">Welldon</persName> wrote to challenge my authority for saying at the Diocesan Conference that all the Chapter approved the <persName id="44">Dean's</persName> action in re. the Athanasian Creed.</p>
         <p><persName id="67">Frank Capon</persName> came to tea &amp; Evensong.</p>
         <p>I preached again at Evensong, when the congregation was moderate, but the collection relatively large, viz &#x00A3;7.8.0</p>
         <p><persName id="370">Bate</persName>, the new 'deputy-organist', came to supper and also <persName id="121">Custard</persName>.</p>
