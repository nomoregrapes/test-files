         <p>There were but 21 comm<hi rend="superscript underline">ts</hi> at 8 a.m.</p>
         <p>At 11 a.m. the church appeared to be well-filled.  I begged hard for the Hospitals, but rather marred the effect of my preaching by losing my place in the middle.  A sheet of the (type-written) sermon had got out of its place.  The Offertory (including &#x00A3;15.1.0 which had been sent to me in advance) amounted to &#x00A3;139.14.4: which is the largest sum collected at a single service in my time in <orgName xml:id="16">S. Margaret's</orgName>.  <persName xml:id="556">George Dennistoun</persName> came to lunch, &amp; <persName xml:id="42">M<hi rend="superscript underline">r</hi></persName> &amp; <persName xml:id="701">M<hi rend="superscript underline">rs</hi> Steele-Maitland</persName>.</p>
         <p>At Evensong there was a moderate congregation.  I preached again.  The Offertory exceeded &#x00A3;26. The <persName xml:id="280">Bishop of Ripon</persName> was preaching at the Abbey.</p>
         <p><persName xml:id="222">Albert Saxton</persName> came to supper, &amp; brought with him another â€˜Old Blue' named <persName xml:id="700" display="no">Ellis</persName>.<note xml:id="37" n="1"></note></p>
