         <p>A dull cold morning, threatening rain. I went to <orgName xml:id="16">S. Margaret's</orgName> at 8 a.m., and celebrated. There were 32 communicants.</p>
         <p><persName xml:id="31">Cecil</persName> was to have preached in the Abbey, but I had heard overnight that he was down with a chill, and had asked <persName xml:id="62">Kirshbaum</persName> to preach in his stead. He preached effectively, &amp; was well heard. Among the congregation was the <persName xml:id="128">Archbishop of Canterbury</persName>.</p>
         <p><persName xml:id="114">Welldon</persName> preached in S. Margaret's, and came to lunch, as did also the <persName xml:id="555" display="no">Precentor</persName>.</p>
         <p>I <listEvent><event xml:id="122">preached</event></listEvent> in the Abbey to a great congregation, which seemed more attentive than heretofore. <hi rend="italic">After service I went to S. Margaret's &amp; </hi><hi rend="italic bold underline">baptized <persName xml:id="554">Gilbert Simpson</persName>, to whom also I stood Godfather.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>At Evensong I preached in S. Margaret's to a large congregation, &amp; thereafter conducted a short devotional service.</p>
         <p><persName xml:id="557" display="no">Lutyens</persName>, <persName xml:id="489">Sherwood</persName>, <persName xml:id="556">George Dennistoun</persName>, Kirshbaum, &amp; <persName xml:id="282">Campbell</persName> came in to supper.</p>
