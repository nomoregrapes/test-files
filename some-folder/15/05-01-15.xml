         <p>A bitter but beautiful morning: the sky was everywhere flecked and streaked with rosy clouds, fit symbols of troubles, yes and of failures &amp; even sins, transfigured and yoked to the bright purposes of Heaven by the rising Sun of Faith.  </p>
         <p>There were 24 communicants at 8 a.m., all women save the clergy, the <persName xml:id="658" display="no">Commodore</persName>, <persName xml:id="222">Albert</persName>, and <persName xml:id="113">Harold</persName>.  At Mattins the congregation appeared large, but the Offertory (&#x00A3;10.19.9 ) suggested that it was but small.  I preached wearily the old sermon which I <listEvent><event xml:id="132" display="no">preached</event></listEvent> in Liverpool on Advent Sunday.  There were 42 comm<hi rend="superscript underline">ts</hi> at the midday Celebration.  At Evensong the congregation was visibly affected by the cold. I preached a sermon patched of old &amp; new.  In the course of it I quoted <persName xml:id="660">Faber</persName>'s fine poem <ref xml:id="61">"The Old Labourer"</ref>, and nearly broke down at the last line, "God hath some grand employment for His Son".</p>
         <p>Then we returned to the Rectory: Albert, <persName xml:id="300">Ellison</persName>, &amp; <persName xml:id="282">Campbell</persName> came in to supper.</p>
