         <p>I went to church for Mattins at 8.30 a.m.  Then I finished a sermon for tomorrow morning, and started on another for the evening.  At 2 p.m. I married <persName xml:id="654" display="no">Captain Baird</persName> and <persName xml:id="655" display="no">Miss Kerr</persName>. Then I took a short turn on the Embankment.  <hi rend="italic"><persName xml:id="113">Harold Knowling</persName> came to write letters for me: and went with a note to the doctor, who arrived about 8pm. He installed a nurse, who was fetched by a messenger lad.  </hi><persName xml:id="542">M<hi rend="i superscript underline">rs</hi><hi rend="italic"> Gow</hi></persName><hi rend="italic"> came in for a consolatory visit.  Then Harold returned to stay the night in order that he might be on the spot to open the Church tomorrow, his first Sunday of undivided responsibility.  At 1.30 a.m. the Nurse came to my study, where I had just finished the second sermon, and asked me to fetch the doctor: so I at once went across to the hospital and caused him to be telephoned for.  He arrived at 2.10 a.m., and immediately got to his work, while I kept a melancholy vigil in my study.</hi>
