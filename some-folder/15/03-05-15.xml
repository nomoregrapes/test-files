         </p>
         <p>The idea occurred to me that we ought to have an amendment, which would give a platform to the moderates. So I drafted one &amp; went with it to the <persName xml:id="44">Dean</persName>. We ultimately determined on the following:</p>
         <p>"That this House do pray his <persName xml:id="128">Grace the President</persName>, &amp; their Lordships the Bishops of the Upper House that in order to allay considerable distress &amp; perplexity felt by many at the present time (owing to the raising of questions regarding the Virgin-Birth &amp; Resurrection of our Lord, they, while re-affirming the belief of the Church, would invite the attention of the theological Professors in the Universities &amp; other official Teachers of Theology to the special need at this time of a reverent and Scholarly study &amp; exposition of these doctrines) [sic] ["]</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="bold underline">The Dean moved this in an admirable speech</hi>, which made a great impression on the House.  The <persName xml:id="387">Dean of Lincoln</persName> seconded, &amp; it was supported by <persName xml:id="109">Wilberforce</persName>, the <persName xml:id="374">Dean of Salisbury</persName>, &amp; <persName xml:id="388">Archdeacon Sumner</persName>.  <persName xml:id="212">Wace</persName> made an effective speech in opposition, &amp; he was followed by the ancient <persName xml:id="377">Archdeacon of Lincoln</persName>.  <hi rend="bold underline"><persName xml:id="376">Knox Little</persName> replied in a ranting speech, which disgusted</hi> <hi rend="bold">[186] </hi><hi rend="bold underline">the House: and then we voted</hi>.  The numbers were 29 against &amp; 21 for the Amendment.  <hi rend="bold underline">The original motion was then carried by 25 to 15</hi>. On the whole this cannot be said to have been an unsatisfactory result. No moral weight attaches to a resolution carried by a mere fraction of the House in the teeth of protracted opposition.</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="italic bold underline">We dined with <persName xml:id="389">Bryce</persName></hi><hi rend="italic">.
