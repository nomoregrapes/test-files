         <p>The idea occurred to me that we ought to have an amendment, which would give a platform to the moderates. So I drafted one &amp; went with it to the <persName id="44">Dean</persName>. We ultimately determined on the following:</p>
         <p>"That this House do pray his <persName id="128">Grace the President</persName>, &amp; their Lordships the Bishops of the Upper House that in order to allay considerable distress &amp; perplexity felt by many at the present time (owing to the raising of questions regarding the Virgin-Birth &amp; Resurrection of our Lord, they, while re-affirming the belief of the Church, would invite the attention of the theological Professors in the Universities &amp; other official Teachers of Theology to the special need at this time of a reverent and Scholarly study &amp; exposition of these doctrines) [sic] ["]</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="b u">The Dean moved this in an admirable speech</hi>, which made a great impression on the House.  The <persName id="387">Dean of Lincoln</persName> seconded, &amp; it was supported by <persName id="109">Wilberforce</persName>, the <persName id="374">Dean of Salisbury</persName>, &amp; <persName id="388">Archdeacon Sumner</persName>.  <persName id="212">Wace</persName> made an effective speech in opposition, &amp; he was followed by the ancient <persName id="377">Archdeacon of Lincoln</persName>.  <hi rend="b u"><persName id="376">Knox Little</persName> replied in a ranting speech, which disgusted</hi> <hi rend="b">[186] </hi><hi rend="b u">the House: and then we voted</hi>.  The numbers were 29 against &amp; 21 for the Amendment.  <hi rend="b u">The original motion was then carried by 25 to 15</hi>. On the whole this cannot be said to have been an unsatisfactory result. No moral weight attaches to a resolution carried by a mere fraction of the House in the teeth of protracted opposition.</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="i b u">We dined with <persName id="389">Bryce</persName></hi><hi rend="i">. I met there also <persName id="390">Lathbury</persName>,</hi> <persName id="391"><hi rend="i">M</hi><hi rend="i superscript">r</hi><hi rend="i"> Justice Kennedy</hi></persName><hi rend="i">, &amp; others.</hi>
