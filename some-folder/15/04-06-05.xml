         <p>Brilliant sunshine &amp; a keen East Wind. I went through my duties with difficulty, being chilled &amp; worried.  There was a numerous (but not a crowded) congregation at Mattins, where I preached an old sermon, designing thus to arm myself with <hi rend="i">a complete defence of making any reference to <persName id="166">Ingram</persName>, </hi><hi rend="i b u">whose public onslaught on me last Tuesday in Ely Cathedral has attracted <ref id="32">general notice</ref></hi><hi rend="i">.</hi>

         <p>I celebrated the Holy Communion after Mattins. <persName id="489">Sherwood</persName> being absent, I went to the Vestry &amp; conducted his Bible Class.</p>
         <p>At Evensong I preached again.  There was a fair congregation.  Offertories throughout: &#x00A3;27.18.3.</p>
         <p><persName id="510">Douglas Eyre</persName> came here &amp; stayed the night.</p>
