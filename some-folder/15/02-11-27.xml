         <p>I took Mattins for <persName id="208">Beeching</persName>: and thereafter wrote letters &amp; attended a meeting of the School Managers. <persName id="76">Carissima</persName> &amp; <persName id="77">Marion</persName> came up from Horley in spite of an ominous fog.  After lunch I took a brief walk on the embankment, and afterwards wrote some more of my sermon for next Sunday.  Then I went with <persName id="112">my wife</persName> to dine with Beeching.  <hi rend="b u"><persName id="103">Ainger</persName> &amp; <persName id="319">Geo: Prothero</persName> were there among others</hi>.</p>
         <p>The <persName id="320">Editor</persName> of the Hibbert Journal asked me to contribute an article to the same.  </p>
