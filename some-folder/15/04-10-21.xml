         <p>Sermon all the morning. I mean to speak quite plainly about Daniel, since we have the legends both morning &amp; evening for lessons.</p>
         <p><persName id="618">Stafford Northcote</persName> lunched here &amp;, then, took me to see the monument to <persName id="187">Farrar</persName>, which he &amp; the other curates of <orgName id="16">S. Margaret's</orgName> under Farrar, design to erect in the porch.  I was shocked &amp; amazed to see a huge thing - 6ft: by 4 - no plans had been sent me beforehand, &amp; certainly no suspicion of anything more than a moderate medallion, such as commemorates <persName id="627">Stokes</persName>, &amp; <persName id="626">Ruskin</persName> in the Abbey, ever crossed my mind. Even Northcote seemed daunted by the size.</p>

<hi rend="i"><persName id="113">Harold Knowling</persName> started working for me as <persName id="293">Edwin</persName>'s successor. He certainly writes a better hand &amp; is quicker</hi>.</p>
