         <p>Dear <persName id="99">M<hi rend="sup u">r</hi> Dean</persName>,</p>
         <p>I am not sure whether I rightly understood what you said to me yesterday with reference to the paragraph in my Parochial Magazine for March.  But I rather gathered that <hi rend="u">somebody</hi> suggested that it involved something of a breach of the obligation to secrecy which protects our capitular discussions, &amp; further that you yourself so far sympathized with that view as to meditate writing to me.</p>
         <p>I do not think you can have read the paragraph, which I, therefore, beg to enclose.  You will observe that absolutely nothing is announced except the fact of our decision, &amp; that my parish Magazine with that announcement did not appear until after the Revised Version was actually being read in the Abbey.  It could not be a breach of confidence to announce a decision which was already being publically acted on.  The offer of the <orgName id="136"><orgName id="137">Burgesses</orgName></orgName> was, of course, in no sense private. In the first instance, the proposal was discussed between them and myself, &amp; certainly, publicity was of the essence of the whole transaction. <hi rend="b">[39] </hi>[symbol] I desired their gift, &amp; the use of the Revised Bible in the Abbey avowedly &amp; obviously because both the one &amp; the other would strengthen my effort to get the Revised Bible generally used in the churches.  Finally, although I had no shadow of doubt as to my liberty in the matter, I was not unobservant of the fact that in a similar instance, when the Chapter requested you to permit, &amp; you did permit a daily Celebration of Holy Communion during Lent, <hi rend="b u"><persName id="49">Canon Gore</persName> at once wrote to the Church papers announcing the decision</hi>, &amp; I am not aware that anybody in or out of the Chapter objected that he had broken his faith to the Chapter. And, certainly, until I am convinced that my view is mistaken, I shall not hesitate on any future occasion to draw public attention to decisions of the Chapter, which are themselves matters of public concern.  The discussions of the Chapter, of course, are &amp; must be private, but the decisions are sometimes by no means so: &amp; I submit that in the case of the Revised Version it is quite grotesque to support the contrary. You will, I am sure, M<hi rend="sup u">r</hi> Dean understand that I write to you <hi rend="b">[40] </hi>because I conceive the matter to be of the greatest possible importance not merely to my reputation &amp; comfort as a member of the Chapter, but also to my conduct in the future in that capacity.</p>
         <p>Believe me,</p>
         <p>Dear M<hi rend="sup u">r</hi> Dean,</p>
         <p>v. faithfully yrs.</p>
         <p>H. HENSLEY HENSON</p></div>
         <p>
<hi rend="b">[41]</hi>
         </p>
         <p>Holy Spirit of God have pity on my weakness &amp; misery, and fulfil in me Thine own Ministry of comfort and cleansing.  I know not how to pray as I ought, for memories of sin confound and abash me, and my way is hidden from view. O merciful Spirit of Jesus make intercession for me. I entreat Thee, that I may not altogether fail &amp; fall from grace.  I confess that I have grieved Thee by my persistent rebellion, nevertheless I come back to Thee, driven by my need.  To Thee, henceforth, I would give myself without reserve for discipline, for direction, for renewal.  O Divine Teacher have compassion on my ignorance: O Sanctifying Spirit pity my sinfulness: O Eternal Advocate protect my weakness.  Lead me in the path of righteousness, and guide my steps in the way everlasting, for the sake of Jesus Christ my Lord.</p>
         <p>Amen</p>

There was a pleasant re-union in <orgName id="7">College</orgName>. Next day, Whit Monday, a small party from Westminster came to Oxford, &amp; I spent the morning in showing them about. They lunched in the Common Room &amp; had tea in my rooms. They were the following:-</p>

         <p><persName id="1709">Perkins</persName> &amp; <persName id="250">Watson</persName>, also, came &amp; helped to entertain them.

Then I returned to Westminster, &amp; took the monthly service for the <orgName id="103">S. Margaret's Guild</orgName>.  On Wednesday I dined with <hi rend="b u"><persName id="1384">Bailward</persName></hi> at 1 Princes Mansions, Victoria Street. <hi rend="b">[43] </hi><persName id="1711">Loch</persName>, <persName id="1712">Champernowne</persName>, &amp; <persName id="1713">Macmillan</persName> formed the party.  <hi rend="b u">On Thursday I went again to Oxford. The Canons' Verger, <persName id="1714">David Waller</persName>, came there, &amp; I showed him about in the morning, gave him lunch, &amp; despatched him</hi>. Later in the day, <persName id="50">Lemare</persName> arrived.  I gave a dinner-party in my rooms to the following.</p>

         <p>On Friday I spent the morning in showing Lemare about.  <persName id="41">Davis</persName> took him on the river in the afternoon, &amp; he went away after dining in Hall by the late train.  I attended the meeting of the Council of the <orgName id="15">Oxford House</orgName> in the <persName id="228">Warden</persName>'s rooms, where <hi rend="b u">we agreed to offer the Headship to <persName id="211">Henry Woolcombe</persName></hi>. On Saturday I returned to Westminster &amp; in the afternoon showed a party from Barking over the Abbey, &amp; gave them tea.</p>
