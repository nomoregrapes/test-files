<hi rend="b">Easter Day, April 23</hi><hi rend="b sup u">rd</hi><hi rend="b">, 1905.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>A brilliant day tailing off disappointingly towards nightfall.  The total number of communicants numbered 395 viz: at 7 a.m. 49: at 8 a.m. 135: at 11 a.m., 208.  This is an increase of 8 over last Easter: and of 13 over the Easter before that.  The congregation at the Choral Celebration was very large, and evidently composed of sight-seers in great part.  I had to intervene in order to arrest the stampede after the hymn, while the collection was yet proceeding.  The offertories were un-wontedly small all day.  I preached twice; both sermons were <hi rend="b u">of an apologetic but mildly heretical character</hi>: a circumstance fairly balanced by an outburst of orthodoxy from 'the Holy Sheep' at S. Paul's.</p>
