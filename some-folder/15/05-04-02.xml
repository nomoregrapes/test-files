         <p>A calm morning &amp; restful to the spirit. I celebrated at 8 a.m.: there were 36 communicants.</p>
         <p>I opened by haphazard a volume of <persName id="676">Tennyson</persName>'s <ref id="64">Poems</ref>, which lay on my table, &amp; mine eye fell on these lines, which seemed the very description of my own spirit's history;</p><div type="verse">

            <item>Lo, falling from my constant mind,</item>
            <item>Lo, parch'd and wither'd, deaf and blind,</item>
            <item>I whirl like leaves in roaring wind.</item>
         </list></div>
         <p>At Mattins there was a fair congregation, but very largely composed of strangers.  <hi rend="b u">Among others I observed <persName id="403">Dicey</persName> &amp; <persName id="502">Alwyn Parker</persName>.</hi>
         </p>
         <p>At the 2<hi rend="sup u">nd</hi> Celebration there were 96 comm<hi rend="sup u">ts</hi>; among these I noticed <persName id="368">Victor Cavendish</persName>, <persName id="677">Sir Elliott Lees</persName>, &amp; <persName id="547">Lady Manners</persName>.</p>
         <p>At Evensong there was a large congregation.</p>
