         <p>Another day of sermon-writing. I looked in at the Organ Recital in <orgName id="16">S. Margaret's</orgName>, &amp; thereafter went a short stroll with <persName id="216">Gow</persName>. <persName id="77">Marion</persName> came up from Horley.  <persName id="401">Sir Edward Russell</persName> sent me copies of the <ref id="45">Liverpool Daily Post</ref> reporting the Church Congress.<note id="82" n="1"></note>  As a matter of fact there was a great calm in respect to all critical issues.  Probably this is mainly advantageous to the cause of liberty.  I notice that <persName id="615">Austin Taylor</persName> spoke very vehemently against the Higher Criticism.  He is young enough to know better.</p>
