         <p>A beautiful day after the rain, which has washed everything &amp; given back lustre to the grass. I celebrated at 8 a.m., there were 20 comm<hi rend="sup u">ts</hi>.</p>
         <p>At 11 a.m. there was a scanty congregation. I preached on â€˜Temptation', taking my text from the epistle for the day. 1. Cor: X.12-13.</p>
         <p>
<hi rend="i">This was </hi><hi rend="i u"><persName id="113">Harold Knowling</persName>'s</hi><hi rend="i"> last day in the choir: when I recall how much pleasure, &amp; I hope also spiritual help his singing has brought to me during these 4 years past, I feel that this is no slight event.  He &amp; I went together to the Charing Cross Hospital to see <persName id="293">Edwin Saxton</persName>, who has been lying there for a fortnight.  Returning, we fell in with <persName id="208">Beeching</persName> on the Embankment, &amp; walked awhile with him.  At Evensong there was a fair congregation, &amp; I preached on "Oppression".</hi>
