Pennington, <i>The Counter-Reformation in Europe</i> (1899), in <i>The Saturday Review</i>, 88, 14 Oct. 1899, 481-2.�This weekly review, known for acerbic reviewing and commentary,�only began�to attribute reviews regularly during�the 1890s: J. Mullan, <i>Anonymity: A Secret History of English Literature</i> (1907), 210. Henson certainly wrote leader columns for the review: see Journal, 26 Aug. 1900."

note19	"William Kenyon-Slaney's amendment to the Unionist government's Education bill of 1902, for Church of England and other voluntary schools made all the school managers, instead of clergymen alone, responsible for the direction of religious teaching.�While it appealed to evangelicals, nonconformists, and erastians, it was denounced by anglo-catholics and high churchmen, including Bishop Gore and Lord Hugh Cecil.� "		
note20	"William Fremantle, dean of Ripon, delivered a lecture entitled 'Natural Christianity'�to the Churchmen's Union in October 1902, which was denounced in the <i>Daily Mail</i>.

note21	"�I venture with the greatest deference to address myself to the Nonconformists, for whom � as they know well � I have a sincere affection and respect, and whose religious fellowship I desire and work for.  Upon them now mainly depends the issue whether the new Act is to be the beginning of a stable and equitable re-organisation of our education on a basis of definite Christianity or whether it is to inaugurate a period of acute sectarian conflict, out of which the only possible escape will be the adoption of a secular system, pure and simple�: �Memorial Services: Westminster Abbey�, Times, 29 Dec. 1902, 5."		
note22	"'Canon Henson's appeal: reply of Free Church leaders', DN, 30 Dec. 1902, 10. The newspaper had�already published a hostile editorial, arguing that Henson�s appeal to nonconformists for co-operation with the Church of England on religious education in schools was an affront to their traditions: �Canon Henson�s Appeal�, DN, 29 Dec. 1902, 4."

For Henson's defence of his opposition to Wace in convocation, see Letter, 'The appeal to the first six centuries', Times, 21 Feb. 1905, 8."		
note41	"Reference might have expected to Nelson as this day was the centenary of the Battle of Trafalgar, which was widely commemorated; but as the celebrations were largely promoted by the Navy League, they fell within Henson's dislike of political partisanship in preaching. Sir Henry Irving was also controversial, despite the privileg of burial in Westminster Abbey, as he was widely thought to have conducted an affair with the actress Ellen Terry."		
note44	"Times, 2 Nov. 1900, 9, reported Henson as saying 'that he would rather trust the destiny of the nations to working men who formed their opinions in a publichouse [sic] than to teetotallers who were supposed to be a pattern of all the virtues.�"
