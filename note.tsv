note2	"St Alban's Diocesan Conference. Henson maintained that 'not until the incumbent and local opinion were entirely disregarded, could an unbiased judgement be brought to bear on the facts'. The bishop of Colchester responsed that 'while Mr Henson was born to amuse, ... he was not always edifying, and [the bishop] regretted the tone of his speech, remarking at the same time that he had given no hint as to how things might be done better than at present': <i>Essex County Chronicle</i>, 2 Nov. 1900, 5."		
note1	"Electoral opinion in favour of the Unionist government. The general election of September-October 1900 was popularly described as the 'Khaki election', because called to take advantage of jingoism during the South African war of 1899-1902, khaki being the light-brown cloth used for British military field uniforms during colonial campaigns.

note9	"A prelude to Henson's determined effort to secure the place of the Revised Version at the lectern in Westminster Abbey, primarily on grounds of conviction but also because of the close association of the Abbey in its creation: <i>Retrospect</i>, I, 57. The work of revision, by members of various protestant churches in England, Wales, Scotland and Ireland, began in 1870 in the Jerusalem chamber of the Abbey: Mark D. Chapman, 'New Testament revision company (act. 1870-81)', ODNB."		
note10	"Henson's first signed article was 'The Society of Jesus', a review of A. P. Pennington, <i>The Counter-Reformation in Europe</i> (1899), in <i>The Saturday Review</i>, 88, 14 Oct. 1899, 481-2. Henson was invited by the editor, Harold Hodge, to become Ã”Church correspondentÃ• for the review in 1898: see Journal, 13 Dec. 1898."

note14	"An incarnationist critique of atonement theology, associated with Reginald John Campbell from the publication of his <i>The New Theology</i> (1907)."		
note16	"Henson's first publicly advocated the cause of reunion of the protestant churches in Britain through intercommunion in his sermon at Great St Mary's Church, Cambridge, 20 Oct. 1901, reprinted as 'An Appeal for Unity', in <i>Godly Union and Concord</i> (1902), 126-44. It followed from his determination to follow Dean Stanley in Westminster Abbey and Canon Farrar, his predecessor at St Margaret's, in making Westminster the centre of a 'national' version of Christianity: <i>Retrospect</i>, I, 51."		
note17	"The British victory in the South African war was sealed by the peace treaty of Vereeniging, on 31 May 1902. Thanksgiving services were held throughout the Church of England on 8 June (a special form of prayer was distributed for the purpose), and the king and queen attended the service in St Paul's Cathedral. Other churches throughout Britain organised thanksgivings on the same day, as did many churches in the empire."		
note19	"William Kenyon-Slaney's amendment to the Unionist government's Education bill of 1902, for Church of England and other voluntary schools made all the school managers, instead of clergymen alone, responsible for the direction of religious teaching. While it appealed to evangelicals, nonconformists, and erastians, it was denounced by anglo-catholics and high churchmen, including Bishop Gore and Lord Hugh Cecil. "		
note21	"I venture with the greatest deference to address myself to the Nonconformists, for whom - as they know well - I have a sincere affection and respect, and whose religious fellowship I desire and work for. Upon them now mainly depends the issue whether the new Act is to be the beginning of a stable and equitable re-organisation of our education on a basis of definite Christianity or whether it is to inaugurate a period of acute sectarian conflict, out of which the only possible escape will be the adoption of a secular system, pure and simple': 'Memorial Services: Westminster Abbey', Times, 29 Dec. 1902, 5."		
note20	"William Fremantle, dean of Ripon, delivered a lecture entitled 'Natural Christianity' to the Churchmen's Union in October 1902, which was denounced in the <i>Daily Mail</i>. He asserted that accounts of the Virgin birth and miracles may have arisen from a misunderstanding, and that there was nothing 'supernatural' about the Resurrection: ODNB and <i>Times</i>, 31 Oct. 1902, 10."		
note22	"Canon Henson's appeal: reply of Free Church leaders', <i>Daily News</i>, 30 Dec. 1902, 10. The newspaper had already published a hostile editorial, arguing that Henson's appeal to nonconformists for co-operation with the Church of England on religious education in schools was an affront to their traditions: 'Canon Henson's Appeal', DN, 29 Dec. 1902, 4."

note27	"The Balkan Committee, established in 1902 sought to mobilise public opinion against Ottoman atrocities in the Balkans. Its vice-presidents included anglican and nonconformist clergymen, including Henry Scott Holland, Samuel Barnett, and John Clifford. Henson's reference to 'too many parsons in politics' referred to clerical interventions in the controversy over Education Act of 1902, particularly the nonconformist campaign of 'passive resistance' organised by Clifford. "		
note35	"Winnington Ingram denounced Henson's views on the Resurrection at the festival of Ely Theological College, Ely Cathedral, 31 May 1904: 'Ecclesiastical Intelligence', <i>Times</i>, 1 June, 1904, 11. "		
note37	"Former pupils of Christ's Hospital School are commonly called 'Old Blues', because the school uniform is a distinctive long blue coat."		
note39	"The lectures were founded by William Jones in 1615, and held at St Margaret Lothbury, City of London. Henson's lectures were entitled 'The Authority of Religion'. The first, on 'The authority of the sacred book' , was reported in <i>Standard</i>, 16 Nov. 1905, but he did not collect the lectures in a volume."		
note40	"Wace had suggested that 'nothing can be truly accepted as Catholic which cannot claim the general assent and observance of the first six centuries': 'The appeal to antiquity', <i>Times</i>, 2 Feb., 1905, 6. For Henson's defence of his opposition to Wace in convocation, see Letter, 'The appeal to the first six centuries', <i>Times</i>, 21 Feb. 1905, 8."		
note41	"Reference might have expected to Nelson as this day was the centenary of the Battle of Trafalgar, which was widely commemorated; but as the celebrations were largely promoted by the Navy League, they fell within Henson's dislike of political partisanship in preaching. Sir Henry Irving was also controversial, despite the privileg of burial in Westminster Abbey, as he was widely thought to have conducted an affair with the actress Ellen Terry."		
note44	"<i>Times</i>, 2 Nov. 1900, 9, reported Henson as saying 'that he would rather trust the destiny of the nations to working men who formed their opinions in a publichouse [sic] than to teetotallers who were supposed to be a pattern of all the virtues.'"		
note45	"Life should be regulated, books should be read, works of theology should be given, one should serve and rejoice.' "

note51	"Henson to Alfred Spelling, 2 Oct. 1900, HHH173, commented that 'The Liberals are making a mistake by attacking Mr Chamberlain so enormously. I think the Government will retain their majority and I hope so'."

note3	"The Westminster canonry offered to Henson was attached to the curacy of St Margaret's. See essay 'St Margaret's and Westminster Abbey'."		
note18	"<i>The Pilot: A Weekly Review of Ecclesiastical and General Politics, Literature and Learning</i>, first issued on 3 March 1900. Edited by D. C. Lathbury and with Charles Gore as a regular contributor, it had a pronounced high church flavour, and was committed to the privileges of the Anglican establishment, notably in its defence of Church schools, at a time when these were under attack from nonconformists. It suffered several crises, finally ending in May 1904. It failed for financial reasons, after a sharp decline in circulation following its support for Joseph Chamberlain's tariff reform policies, which were unpopular with many liberal high churchmen."		
note8	"The case referred to the proposed reduction of the powers of the dean and chapter in Westminster under changes in local government law. See essay 'St Margaret's and Westminster Abbey'. "		
note29	"The so-called 'Beeby case' raged through the Church of England, religious periodicals and the British newspaper press throughout the winter of 1903-4. It arose after Charles Beeby, a well-known liberal churchman, published an article in the recently founded <i>Hibbert Review</i> which effectively denied the virgin birth. Charles Gore of Worcester, his diocesan bishop, condemned Beeby's arguments, and was perceived to have accused him of breaking his ordination vows. In consequence, amid much controversy, Beeby resigned his living."		
note26	"Henson would have been expected to resign from his 'Â£50' fellowship at All Souls after his marriage in October 1902: see essay on All Souls College. "		
note52	"At the general election of January-February 1906, the Conservatives and Liberal Unionists lost 246 MPs; many had been members of the congregation at St Margaret's. The Liberals gained 214 MPs, many returned as a result of an upsurge of political nonconformity, stimulated particularly by the Unionist government's Education Act. A Liberal government supported by as many as 185 nonconformist MPs was an obvious threat to numerous privileges of the Church of England. "

note55	"The tension centred on what Henson perceived as Armitage Robinson's lack of collegiality. See essay 'St Margaret's and Westminster Abbey'. "		
note58	"Lady Frances Balfour had appealed to Henson for information on Nicoll [sic], a leading critic of the 1902 Education Act passed by the government of her brother, the prime minister Arthur Balfour. She also reported the unsettling effect of Henson's recent theological pronouncements within her circle of acquaintances: see <i>Retrospect</i>, I, 75."		
note61	"Henson argued that while the clergy must take their stance on public questions in accordance with their religion, they must abstain from party politics. This was especially important for the clergy of a Church which professed to be national: <i>Westminster Gazette</i>, 14 Oct. 1905, 2."		
note59	"Henson did not mention his last lecture, 'Apostolic succession', delivered on 15 December 1901, and published in <i>Christian World Pulpit</i>, 25 Dec. 1901, 401-4."

note73	"Henson sought to raise money for the restoration work needed at St Margaret's soon after he became rector. See essay 'St Margaret's and Westminster Abbey'."		
note85	"Henson preached what he called a 'political sermon' in St Margaret's on the first Sunday of the Parliamentary session, avoiding partisanship but addressing 'the great moral issues which appeared to me to need specific emphasis': <i>Retrospect</i>, I, 133."		
note92	"Henson again made the case for his appointment to Ilford in a long letter to Lord Salisbury written the same day: Henson to Lord Salisbury, 23 Nov. 1900, HHA, 3M/H4. Stevens was duly appointed. "

note13	"i.e. the archbishops of Canterbury and York."		
note15	"The <i>Church Times</i> reported the 'curious line' Robinson took on the proposal to re-translate the Athanasian Creed.ÃŠSupported by Henson, he maintained that re-translation would not affect the compulsory use of the <i>Quicunque vult</i> ('whosever wishes (to be saved)') clause on certain days.ÃŠToning down the language of the creed would misrepresent the mind of the fifth-century Churchman to the modern worshipper. Robinson and Henson wanted public use of the clause to be either forbidden or made optional: 7 June 1901, 679."		
note23	"The source of the Knowlings' is the predatory behaviour of Archibald Routledge towards Harold."		
note28	"The bill, toÃŠcreate new diocesesÃŠforÃŠnew, large, urban populations, was subjected to unexpected opposition, both within and outside parliament, during 1903-4.ÃŠThis was led by mainly anglican Ã”anti-ritualistsÃ•, whoÃŠargued that church discipline against anglo-catholic ritualists shouldÃŠbe restored,before the creation of new dioceses.ÃŠThe Bishoprics of Birmingham and Southwark Act received the royal assent in May 1904."

note43	"The Royal Commission on Ecclesiastical Discipline had beenÃŠappointed byÃŠthe prime minister, A. J.ÃŠBalfour, in 1904 to enquire intoÃŠbreaches of the law on theÃŠconduct of worship in the Church of England, following intense publicÃŠcontroversy overÃŠanglo-catholic 'ritualism',ÃŠaroused byÃŠ'protestant' anti-ritualists.ÃŠA leading proposal of its Report, published in 1906,ÃŠwas aÃŠrevision of <i>The Book of Common Prayer</i>, to redefine the boundaries of acceptable worship.ÃŠHenson's criticisms of the Report are inÃŠ'Report of the Royal Commission on Ecclesiastical Discipline', <i>Contemporary Review</i>, 90 (Aug. 1906), 244, 255-6,ÃŠandÃŠ'The Ecclesiastical Discipline report, II', <i>Contemporary Review</i>, 90 (Sept. 1906), 408-25.

note46	"Joseph Chamberlain's amendment to the Education bill of 1906 provided for separate denominational religious teaching in public elementaryÃŠschools during compulsory hours, albeit privately funded, and with a right to withdraw children from all such teaching. This was in place of the Government proposal to limit religious teaching in school hours to Cowper-Temple teaching.ÃŠVoluntary schools with a clear majority of pupils from the denomination they served would not be subject to the amendment.

note62	"Henson attacked the principle of apostolic succession as an obstacle to reunion of the protestant churches in Britain, and claimed that it was held in contempt by the mass of the English laity. He was proud to associate himself with Archbishop Tait, Bishop Wilberforce, Deans Stanley and Bradley, Canon Ainger, and others who had accepted invitations to preach in the Church of Scotland, but whose ministers were unable to reciprocate.

note81	"The review broughtÃŠoutÃŠthe fluidity of HensonÃ•s sympathies within the Church, and the tensions in his thought as a result.ÃŠNevertheless, he was givenÃŠcredit as a Ã”modern AnglicanÃ•, developing a form of Ã”sacerdotal rationalismÃ• against the sympathy forÃŠRoman catholicism amongst theÃŠTractarians.ÃŠ Henson's recognition of theÃŠcontribution of the nonconformity to religious life, and hisÃŠadvocacy of reunion between the Church of England and the nonconformist sects, were welcomed:ÃŠ<i>Daily News</i>, 19 [sic] Nov. 1900, 6."
